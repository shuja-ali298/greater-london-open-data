<title>Incomplete clearance of overgrown vegetation still obstructing pavement and roadway, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667605</link>
<description>I am writing to formally appeal the handling of this issue, as the recent works carried out did not fully address the problem originally reported.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While some cutting appears to have taken place, other overgrown vegetation remains and continues to significantly impede both the pavement and the edge of the roadway. As a result, pedestrians are still being forced into the road to pass. This is creating severe difficulty and genuine safety concerns, particularly when walking with children, pushchairs, or for anyone with reduced mobility.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In practical terms, navigating this stretch feels unsafe and unpredictable, with branches and vegetation obstructing the path at head and body height. It is not an exaggeration to say that pedestrians are being ambushed by overgrowth when trying to pass through, which defeats the purpose of the initial intervention.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This issue was previously reported under reference number 8482318, which clearly outlined the safety risks and the need for urgent, comprehensive trimming to restore safe public access. Unfortunately, the current state suggests that the work was incomplete and the hazard remains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I respectfully request that this location is re-inspected as a priority and that all remaining overgrown vegetation obstructing the pavement and roadway is properly cut back to ensure the route is fully and safely passable.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Heathside Avenue, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667605&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>URGENT - Street light not working Selborne Road, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667581</link>
<description>URGENT - Street light in Selborne Road not working. This has been reported under FixMyStreet ref: 8586818 and FixMyStreet ref: 8637265. This is now my 3rd report! Despite providing all the relevant information to the lighting department by email at their request on the non working street lamp in Selborne Road, I received notifications that it has been fixed. I further add these notifications were not related to my report reference FixMyStreet ref: 8586818 and 8637265. THIS HAS NOT BEEN FIXED!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The street lamp has been photographed and send to you three times!!! Normally the street lamps have a number on the front; I have taken a note of the number at the back of the one that is not working: GB13/89351. Please could you have this fixed ASAP as the area is very dark without lighting. Thank you!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8667581.0.jpeg?f462ca23&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Selborne Road, Camberwell, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667581&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Not sure how big or deep it is, as it’s full of water now., 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667511</link>
<description>The pothole is a drain cover that has collapsed I guess now. It’s hard to tell because of the water. But as the buses are driving through, it’s splashing the water up the road, which is turning icy in the cold weather.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8667511.0.jpeg?809267b8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Plumstead High Street, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667511&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Series of household waste such as settee, beds and other household waste have been dumped since last week under the tree on Avocet Mews. Your warning notice about prosecution has not deterred these fly tipping criminals. They’ve dumped all these items under the large tree that faces number 28 Avocet Mews Thamesmead London SE28. The tree is also at the bottom of of the garden of number 36 and 37 Harrier Mews and part of the base of the tree falls on Wren Path. This tree is a famous location for fly tippers and I’ve reported countless incidents to you over the years about this tree location being a favourite location for fly tippers. It is so inconsiderate and wicked of residents to do this to other people. Why should I wake up to this mound of waste visible right outside my bedroom window. The council is not doing enough to protect us from these fly tippers. I have asked for cameras to be planted around this tree to catch these criminals but my suggestion has not been heeded. Please kindly investigate and remove these household waste. Than you., 11th January</title>

<description>Please see comments above. We cannot continue to live like this. Until the council makes an example of one or all these criminals, this appalling behaviour will continue.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Avocet Mews, Thamesmead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667258&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
