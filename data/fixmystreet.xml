<title>Westminster College Paddington Campus Littering, 7th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8266279</link>
<description>The public area near the Berkeley building (Westmarktower and surroundings) is regularly littered and unhygienic due to students from Westminster College. They habitually leave opened food packaging, spill food in the bushes, and frequently trespass into the private gardens of the Berkeley building. The lack of accountability and enforcement is concerning, particularly as these facilities and activities are funded by taxpayers. There seems to be little or no action by the council or college to address the repeated destruction and wastage occurring in these communal spaces.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8266279.0.jpeg?2b7c010d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Newcastle Place, Paddington, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8266279&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Confusing traffic light system, 7th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8266183</link>
<description>Turning right from Bellenden road onto Peckham High Street there is an immediate paedistrian crossing. This has a posed a safety issue as once you are allowed to turn right onto the high street, some cars cross the red light of the paedistrian crossing to avoid holding up traffic in the box junction. The paedistrian crossing traffic light need to be in sync with the traffic lights used to control joining traffic from bellenden road. At the moment cars are forced to run a red light and it is unsafe for paedistrians.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bellenden Road, Peckham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8266183&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Open air dump by bus stop on Woolwich New Road / SE18 6UX, 7th October</title>

<description>I would like to report excessive litter dumping in the area surrounding this bus stop on Woolwich New Road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This corner has effectively become an open-air dump, with litter sometimes overflowing onto the street, sidewalks and even onto our estate, Trinity Walk.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I contacted Pinnacle, the company that manages our estate, but they have stated that this area falls under the councilâ€™s responsibility.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The volume of rubbish is concerning and does not seem environmentally healthy.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate your help to make this a nice area to live in.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Could you please look into this matter and advise on what action can be taken to address the litter?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8266145.0.jpeg?f00ff698&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Woolwich New Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8266145&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The flags are back, 7th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8266104</link>
<description>Multiple flags and bunting on the Horse roundabout again. As before, causing obstruction to views in all directions for traffic. This is going to cause an accident before long. Also, there is now graffiti on the flags that some woudl consider offensive. Something really needs to be done about this moving forward as these flags are a public nuisance and someone will get hurt on this busy roundabout.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lower Belvedere, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8266104&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
