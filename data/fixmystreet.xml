<title>Broken door and broken fence along brook path, 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8411719</link>
<description>There used to be a door to this path and it has been broken for a year or so. The fences have also broke. I’ve seen curious secondary school children wandering into that path and there is a risk of falling into the brook. For public safety, I think the door and fence should be fixed like the one on cromwell road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8411719.0.jpeg?026e03c6&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hampden Road, Elmers End, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8411719&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Parking, 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8411649</link>
<description>My driveway is constantly blocked by cars because there is no parking restrictions or anything. Is there anything that I can do or can be done. I have a 4 month old child where I’ve had to take to appointments via public transport because I am not able to exit my own driveway. Please help. I have left notes on these specific cars that have been doing it which has had no effect. We have spoke to the drivers also but no result please could you advise me on what the next step is.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8411649.0.jpeg?38b8174b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Shrewsbury Lane, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8411649&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Huge A-board obstructing the footway, 12th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8411483</link>
<description>An enormous A-board advertising Boxhall is regularly obstructing the very busy eastern footway of Old Broad Street outside the entrance to The Arcade, by number 71.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The City&amp;#39;s current transport strategy rightly places great emphasis on keeping our footways free of obstructions, and a clear policy of no permission for A-boards is top of the list of actions listed in Outcome 3, Proposal 16, on page 62 of the City of London&amp;#39;s transport strategy, second edition October 2024.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please advise the business owner that they do not have permission and enforce if necessary. The thousands of people who use this narrow footway daily will be grateful.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8411483.0.jpeg?afad19e2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 55, Old Broad Street, City of London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8411483&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
