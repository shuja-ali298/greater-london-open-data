<title>Gladiator street, 12th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697884</link>
<description>It&amp;#39;s very upsetting that we are lied to and told our street we are the tax payers fir a service we don&amp;#39;t get, not ber cleaned in weeks and no one believes us. Dirty rubbish and empty bottkes blowing around esp after nin collection dsy. Pavements and herbs littered. Not acceptable but we are given e my uses that this will be inspected rather than swept weekly like we are told it woujd be and never happens! Disgraceful. We will now go to our local councillors- that we pay our council tax and a simple thing like keeping our pavements and kerbs clean and clutter free, we we say our pavements are not swept we are not believed, reply of our riload swept Mondays never happens! Hazardous for elderly, wheelchair users and chikdren, we have reported this many times and excuses and lies come after! Never a good clean! Unacceptable and illegal as we pay for a service that the council do not provide.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gladiator Street, Honor Oak, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697884&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>No online payment for car park, 12th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697883</link>
<description>I planned to park on May 30th and checked payment possibilities the day before on internet. Online payment was indicated as accepted. Arriving on the parking lot I tried to pay through RingGo app but I never received SMS (maybe because my phone number is french). I also tried to call the service to pay by phone but the server never recognized my car registration number (maybe because of my french accent). I had no change (reason why I checked online payment the day before) and was also in a hurry. I paid the resulting penalty of charge but I find the situation very unfair as I really had intention to pay for parking. Bottom line. Can you please indicate that online payment cannot work for foreigners. Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harrow Manorway, West Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697883&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Lime trees overhanging pavement, 12th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697869</link>
<description>The lime trees on Mays Hill Road (section near numbers 64-66 in particular) are overgrowing the pavement. When bins are out (see photos) there is little room for pedestrians to pass safely. Should be a quick and easy job to prune these back.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7697869.0.jpeg?28f6dc3e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): May&#39;s Hill Road, Shortlands, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697869&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>About 10 bags of rubbish dumped, flies now everywhere, 12th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697791</link>
<description>I&amp;#39;ve reported this once already but about 10 bags of rubbish have been fly tipped on Craigerne Road about 3 days ago. Some of the bags are now ripped open and there are loads of flies everywhere. It&amp;#39;s right across the pavement and really smelly and disgusting. Lots of children come this way to school everyday and it&amp;#39;s not fair that they have to pass through this. Could it please be fixed? Really awful! Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7697791.0.jpeg?fe30276d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 58, Craigerne Road, Kidbrooke, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7697791&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
