<description>Two ladies in traditional African dress dumped a bedframe, mattress and bedding in Lenton Path, against a house wall. They said that they would remove it but just moved it a few yards to a garden wall then ran away.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7824443.0.jpeg?84d1b979&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tuam Road, Plumstead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7824443&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Honiton Road, 7th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7824422</link>
<description>The whole of Honiton Road and both sides of the junction of this street with Hartland Road have not been cleaned for so long that leaves are blocking drains, as they mix with the dirt and other detritus left uncleaned. Not only it is very dirty and detrimental to the inhabitants and visitors of the street but it is also creating serious hazards and flooding issues as illustrated by the pictures taken after a recent rain episode. In addition, when so many leaves eventually make their way into the main rain collectors, it can clog them up, build up inside pressure and cause serious damage to the system, triggering costly repairs to the council tax payers. Please do act immediately to remedy the situation and remove all leaves and detritus of the street. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7824422.0.jpeg?60838ea2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Honiton Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7824422&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Light pollution from new garage lighting, 7th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7824346</link>
<description>Four extremely bright floodlight-style fittings have recently been installed at the rear of our property, facing directly into our windows. They are on 24/7, with no shielding or directional control, and shine straight into our bedroom and study, making it feel like daylight at night. This is causing significant disturbance and will be worse in winter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These are not standard street lights - they appear more like garage/floodlights and are inappropriately positioned for a residential area. We urgently request that the council reassess their necessity, brightness, angle, and operating hours, and install shields, dimmers, or timers as appropriate.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7824346.0.jpeg?7e9ab5c7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gibbon Road, Nunhead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7824346&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7824292</link>
<description>I reported this big pothole previously under ref 7679506. I was told it was not serious enough for immediate repair and would be re-inspected 14 days later. I don&amp;#39;t think it was re-inspected and I believe the first assessment to have been a mistake; it&amp;#39;s a big pothole. Please could you ask the guys to have another look and double check they have the right location.

<title>Excessively bright lighting, 7th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7824279</link>
<description>Excessively bright security lighting has been installed along the garages close to the rear of our house. I understand the need for security lighting but this is causing distress and preventing adequate sleep for my household as it has excessively lit up the bedrooms and the living space. 4 months ago, we put up blackout blinds to initially mitigate the issue but more have now been installed and it is an unacceptable amount of white light to be shining into a house.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7824279.0.jpeg?1da18f87&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Selden Road, New Cross Gate, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7824279&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
