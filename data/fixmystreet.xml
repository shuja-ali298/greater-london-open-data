<title>It is reasonably (substantially) bigger hole and is deep., 9th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8276302</link>
<description>It is reasonably (substantially) big pothole and is deep. Also it appears that it is not new, surprisingly. Which means, and it appears that it has not been addressed so far - not sure if members of public or any person reporter earlier on this or not. And, it is the main road where buses (more than one bus) ply and pass through regularly, and multiple times a day. For me, while I was trying to turn over to from main road (new road) to a monk road, my noticed my car tyre hit this existing gap. I stopped, there itself and it did (made me feel as a driver) that it is not a normal (not a usual) pothole. I got down the car, stopping immediately and then noticed that it is deep and wider and crumbling down and wide (as it appears). Photos, I took, are attached for reference and so it can be looked in to and addressed before it impacts and becomes more damaging to vehicles and beings.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8276302.0.jpeg?b4da7079&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): New Road, West Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8276302&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
