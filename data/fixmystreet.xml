<title>Lights on poole court not working, 8th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8270671</link>
<description>Lights on the stairwell and outside flats on poole court are not working - they were fixed earlier this year and are now not working. It&amp;#39;s dangerous as it presents a trip hazard and safety issues as you can&amp;#39;t see who is on the stairs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): St Peters Way, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8270671&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Street light broken, 8th October</title>

<description>The street light on the block of 37 Smith Square is broken. Not only does it not work, the pole is about 1/3 the size it should be. Someone took down this street light, and at night it is very dark and feels unsafe for those who live on that block.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 3, Smith Square, Millbank, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8270601&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dear sir madam sorry to hear your car has been clothed just want to give you an update Irish travellers love stealing Toyota cars it is one of their favorites to nick.

They also cloned the vehicle so the authority do not know the vehicle is stolen for transport.Yes, the Toyota Corolla is a famous and best-selling car in Ireland, frequently appearing in the top positions for new car sales, with the Corolla Cross also being a leading model in recent months. The Corolla is celebrated for its value and reliability, becoming a popular choice for Irish motorists., 8th October</title>

<title>Endless endless litter, only getting worse, 8th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8270483</link>
<description>The path that runs from Kidbrooke Way through to Kidbrooke Station round the back of Aldi is becoming one of the most disgusting places to walk. I go down there most mornings for work and it seems to be a magnet for litter. There are all your classics, crushed cans, used food boxes, crisp wrappers, but perhaps more concerningly is blue rubble sacks of rubbish, what look like large collections of boxes being dumped there, wrapping plastic, polystyrene boxes. It goes on and on and on and it seems to be getting worse - literally by the day. Someone is hanging dog poo bags on the same rogue nail on a broken fence post. While I respect that this could be a legitimate attempt at making an artistic statement on the state of the world, it&amp;#39;s not all that pleasant to walk past. There is not a single bin down the path, which obviously makes the issue worse, but concerningly, it seems that the area is not covered by street cleaning teams whatsoever. Can we please get this seen to? Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8270483.0.jpeg?99fe7513&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 241, Kidbrooke Park Road, Kidbrooke, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8270483&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Updates Dear sir madam. I am truly sorry to hear that somebody has cloned your vehicle. You have done the right thing by reporting it to the police for whatever good it is. Metropolitan safer neighbourhood are quite lazy in hackney. Police officers have more time to sit on public park benches instead of investigate any crimes. This is a very common offence cloning vehicles going on in Hackney you have Irish travellers who still cars all the time, clone vehicles for all kinds of purposes. To park illegally. To get free petrol. To get free tax,To get free MOT free insurance. To hide stolen vehicles identity. To evade police detection AMPR. Hackney Council also our very lazy and incompetent in dealing with these reports. You would think your local authority would work together to put a stop to this criminal behavior in the borough of Hackney. The mayor has more time for Hackney Central and making loads of cycle routes then tackling antisocial behavior. Parking fine. Reported via mobile in the Illegal Parking category anonymously at 12:09, Thursday 15 May 2025 Sent to Hackney Council 40 minutes later. FixMyStreet ref: 7573685. Hi, I keep receiving parking fines on my car (reg: FM07LFK) I don&#39;t even live in Hackney, I have reported to the police that I believe my number plate has been clonned, (ref: cad 3150) Could you please get to me regarding this issue and how do I resolve, 8th October</title>
