<title>2 lamp post lights behind cowen house as well as the childrens play park., 29th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792519</link>
<description>2 lamp post lights that light up the children&amp;#39;s play park area and the green area behind cowen house, it&amp;#39;s very dangerous and very dark at night especially when people coming home from work or walking there dogs and have to walk through this area to get home or go to the shops. These lamp posts have not been working for months now and as it&amp;#39;s dark earlier it&amp;#39;s quite scary.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Mayplace Lane, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792519&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Use mattress left outside bin cupboard, 29th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792504</link>
<description>There is a double/king size mattress left on the street outside the bin cupboards of the flats on Oakhurst Grove. This is unsightly from my window opposite and obviously unhygienic. It has been there for over a week and the bins have been emptied so I sure the bin men would have to report it yet it has not been removed. People continue to dump their rubbish there so why not install cameras as a deterrent.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1b, Oakhurst Grove, East Dulwich, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792504&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>General disrepair, 29th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792503</link>
<description>Along the length of the Golden Jubilee footbridge on the north-east side there is graffiti, general soiling, uncollected rubbish, including food, cracked pavement tiles, weeds growing etc. This is particularly bad around the elevator/lift on the South Bank side, closest to Royal Festival Hall, but it extends across the entirety of the bridge, including the footsteps down to Embankment Station on the other side. It&amp;#39;s awful and presents such a terrible picture to those arriving into central London from Waterloo Station, one of the largest in the country. I walk that route every day and it&amp;#39;s never been addressed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Golden Jubilee Bridge, Waterloo, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792503&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overfull bins and no collection for more than a week, 29th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792430</link>
<description>It has happened again!!!!! Our fellow citizens that pass by as well as neighbours from streets around this hot spot have caused the bins to be overfilled again. There is nothing we can do about it as we can’t his them away like others can. And the street is an intensely used pedestrian short cut where people seem to finish there take away meek just at the point where the bins are. Now the foxes have had their go as well so the mess will just get worse. Please come and empty these before it becomes an even worse flytipping location. As ever much respect to all of the team at the refuse management and collection works. I am sorry you will have to tidy up after our spoiled fellow citizens.

<title>Yellow line missing, 29th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792328</link>
<description>Previously, in front of Arona House property (BR36AB), there was a yellow that prevented vehicles from parking too close to the entrance of the parking area. This line was particularly important for maintaining visibility when exiting onto the main road. Since the road was newly laid, the yellow line has not been repainted. As a result, we are now experiencing frequent issues with vehicles parking too close to the entrance, which significantly reduces visibility and makes it difficult and potentially unsafe to drive out onto the main road. I would be grateful if you could arrange for the yellow line to be reinstated as soon as possible&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shortlands, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8792328&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
