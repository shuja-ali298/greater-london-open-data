<title>Fly tipping and not disposing of rubbish correctly, 13th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7869045</link>
<description>Its been reported numerous of times that people around hill view drive keep and William Newman court keep dumping their bulky household furniture and garden waste in the alleyway or in our communal bin area. Today a particular couple of hill view drive who have just moved out today have been witnessed dumping their household furniture into our communal bin area not even in the bin they were asked by 2 people who live here to take their rubbish to the dump an they of course lied and left their furniture in our communal bin area which then stops the bins being collected and people think it is acceptable to dump all number of things into the bin area. This causes issues for people in wheelchairs because the rubbish has blocked people accessing the bins. The furniture has now been moved to outside of the property so that the bin men can change our bins otherwise they refuse and this can cause maggots and flies. there are two alleyway the one where the bins get collected and also the other side where people live and the man on the ground floor is in a wheel chair cannot use the alleyway because he cannot get past. There needs to be a better solution for the bin area because people use this sneakily at night time dumping all sorts of rubbish and bulky household items and residents of the area have to clean it because otherwise bins wont get taken and people cant dispose of rubbish correctly. There are two entrances to it and this needs to be resolved once and for all, maybe give people fobs so they we know only people of the block can use the bins, there needs to be cameras so that fly tipping can be reported and people dealt with correctly way.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7869045.0.jpeg?4f41c52d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Falconwood, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7869045&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
