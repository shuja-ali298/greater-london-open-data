<description>There some kind of problem underground that they need to fix. 2am in the morning they finished yesterday started again at 8am stopped at 1pm and have turned up at 8pm with all the heavy noisy equipment. They’re digging the road up now, instead of the afternoon. I can’t go through another night like last night. 😭They told me it’s going to go on for around a week. I wish I could send you a video so you could understand just how load it is. My whole house is vibrating. I’m cabin crew and have to be up at 4am on Saturday morning for a 12 hour flight. If I don’t sleep I can’t work. I feel sick the noise is so bad.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8798087.0.jpeg?13930f1a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Alexandra Road, Penge, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8798087&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
