<title>Fly tipping of furniture, 10th September</title>

<description>This has been on Allerton Road for several weeks. The other items left beside ot have been taken away by the council but this has been left. Leaving it there will only encourage more fly tipping in what is already an area used all the time to dump stuff.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8147476.0.jpeg?58bedad0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Lordship Park Mews, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8147476&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Disgusting rubbish left every single day HEALTH HAZARD, 10th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8147466</link>
<description>Outside 325 Upper Elmer’s End Road the pavement is being used as a dumping ground for rubbish bags, and it is now completely unacceptable. There are mountains of waste left outside which are forcing people to walk into the road to get past. Parents with buggies cannot get through and residents are having to cross or avoid the street altogether. The smell, mess and sight of it is absolutely disgusting. Foxes are constantly ripping open the rubbish bags and spreading the waste even further, and this has been happening every day for weeks. This is a health hazard, a safety issue, and a disgrace to the area. The council needs to act urgently to remove this rubbish and put measures in place to stop people dumping here in future.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Upper Elmers End Road, Upper Elmers End, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8147466&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bus stop OP on Great Titchfield Street/Oxford Circus there is what appears to be dog/human fececs., 10th September</title>

<description>Behind our flats, mine is 193, but is affecting lots of neighbours, we have very high trees between the state and the railway. Railway. These belong to Bromley.

<title>Waste deliberately taken out of bin, 10th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8147424</link>
<description>Location: 5 Marcia Road. The bins - number 5 and the one next to it are continuously being ransacked and the rubbish is being thrown across the front of the property and causing a concern for attracting pests. Additionally this is unhygienic. This has happened before in the last 7 days and is becoming a concern for our safety as well as it seems targeted - none of the other bins and properties seem to be experiencing this problem. Could this please be cleaned up and any advice or action regarding this problem issue please be relayed back. Thank you for your time.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8147424.0.jpeg?f0bc727e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Marcia Road, Old Kent Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8147424&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
