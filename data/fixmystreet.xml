<description>Please arrange for the curbs to be marked with double yellow lines to stop this repeat offender from parking and obstructing the driveways. We have put out cones and he moves them 4 days a week then parks using a disabled badge with no signs of a disability.

<title>Bins being used to block parking, 21st August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8058785</link>
<description>4 bins have been placed in the road outside 17 and 15 Percy Road to stop anyone parking there for at least 2 weeks, and taking up space for at least 3 cars. As the residents have to pay for the privilege to park here in marked bays - some of whom are elderly and/or have disabilities - this is unfair. I understand that building supplies deliveries need to be made but I&amp;#39;ve only witnessed 2 in the past week, so having these spaces out of action for 2 whole weeks is unacceptable.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Percy Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8058785&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Inappropriate location and use of commercial food and waste bins and refuse, 21st August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8058661</link>
<description>Hello A new business is using the pavement to store its commercial waste wheelie bins . They are on the street at all times and are full of food waste and attracting fly tipping and general misuse by passers by. They are also blocking the pavement from proper use. These bins should be stored inside the business premises not on the street, they are unsightly, unhygienic and promoting general bad behaviour in the alley including dog and human fouling. The issue has been going on for the past month or so, I have already made one complaint amd not received any feedback or seen any improvement or action. Please see photo as it describes the situation but does not illustrate that pedestrians are forced into the road to pass this corner now or that a wheelchair user could not use this pavement . This urgently needs to be addressed with the business owner and the bins moved or removed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8058661.0.jpeg?cb1b8c81&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shand Street, The Borough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8058661&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
