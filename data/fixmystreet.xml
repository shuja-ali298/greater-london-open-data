<title>Very slippery icy pavement, 3rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621378</link>
<description>I was walking with my little baby in a pushchair along Albemarle Rd (from high street towards Westgate) and fell down with the pushchair when crossing Penrith Close. I was very careful but the pavement is not only icy but also a little bit slopping so it&amp;#39;s very easy to lose control and sideslip. Luckly I was with my husband so he caught a pushchair and nothing happened to our baby but I badly hurt my knee so please be careful when walking Albemarle Rd. This section needs urgent deicing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Albemarle Road, Beckenham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621378&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Random people dumping, 3rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621339</link>
<description>There is an alleyway at the back of my house. People seem to be quite happy dumping their unwanted stuff. I have managed to get rid of a few things, but there is a lot more behind there. That doesn’t belong to me or my neighbours it’s not fair on us. I’ve seen people dump it. I’ve told them to stop doing it and they just say make me. I have a few cats that have trouble going through what people have chucked down at the back of our houses and to be honest I don’t really want to go to the Vet every time my cat gets stuck somewhere or hurts them selfs. I’m not the only one who has animals.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Glendower Crescent, Poverest, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621339&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bin men have left large and heavy domestic waste containers where they shouldn’t be, 3rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621228</link>
<description>Contractors have left large and heavy domestic waste containers in a way which a) obstructs the pedestrian crossing, b) partially obstructs the driveway to the car park that serves the block of flats c) presents fly tippers with a way to easily and illegally dispose of their rubbish.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not the first time that contractors have not put bins back where they should be on this development but normally it is the recycling wheelie bins which are easier to move. These bins they have left on this occasion are large and heavy and should not be moved by residents especially as they need to be lifted up a kerb to get them back where they belong.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please ask your contractors to return and complete their job to a satisfactory standard and instruct them to put containers back where they find them on this development. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8621228.0.jpeg?1f1f8c75&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Downsbridge Road, Shortlands, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621228&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
