<title>SAFETY: Treacherous Ice on Footpath, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8639728</link>
<description>A section of footpath over the Creek Traffic Bridge is very dangerous for pedestrians. This section has NOT been salted, and is particularly slippery.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Three families that I spoke to this morning had all slipped / fallen-over on this section of pavement whilst taking their children to school. My son also fell over and landed badly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The affected section is the pavement on Creek Road, descending towards Norway Street, i.e. on the North-East section of the traffic Bridge (see photos)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The only safe route was to walk in the Bicycle Lane, which appears to have been salted.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Make no mistake - this section of footpath is treacherous !&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please add to the Highways &amp;quot;Salting Schedule&amp;quot; as a specific &amp;quot;slip / accident&amp;quot; risk to ensure this section receives salt-treatment going-forwards - thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8639728.0.jpeg?8a34de37&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Creek Road, Deptford&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8639728&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
