<title>Constant inconsiderate parking, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8644386</link>
<description>Parking is very limited, but the same car is constantly taking up 2 spaces with 1 car despite numerous friendly conversations. It’s getting to a point where we are having to block in other residents to be able to park because this same grey Audi doesn’t know how to park his car. As a suggestion, could we potentially look into making the car park residents only by means of permit or gate installation, or at a minimum installing parking bay lines to clearly outline where to park. The parking area usually fits 6 vehicles however due to the inconsiderate parking of the Audi on a daily basis we can only fit 4 vehicles. The carpark in question is at 357-367 Plumstead high street SE181JX, the entrance to the carpark is via woodhurst road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Woodhurst Road, Abbey Wood&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8644386&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
