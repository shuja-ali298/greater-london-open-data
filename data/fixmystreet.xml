<title>Junction of West End Lane and Iverson Road, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8850329</link>
<description>The three-way temporary traffic lights at the junction of West End Lane and Iverson Road are not providing a safe crossing of West End Lane, which is a busy crossing used by people changing from the Thameslink to the Jubilee Line. When the green man is on (with beeping) there is almost always still a long stream of vehicles travelling through the junction south down West End Lane.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The problem seems to be three things: 1. The lights for the vehicles travelling south are too far away to the north on West End Lane from the pedestrian crossing 2. The traffic cannot travel through the distance south to the crossing quickly enough because the road is too narrow, particularly as many of the vehicles are double decker buses 3. When they do get through, it is often not possible to clear the junction due to traffic further along to the south on West End Lane. The phasing of the lights may also be an issue, but simply changing this is not going to make this crossing safe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The lights have been in place for two weeks now. The longer they are in place as they are, the greater the risk that somebody is going to get seriously hurt simply for using what should be a safe crossing. Just yesterday, the beeping started to signal that there was a green man and at that exact moment two double decker buses were approaching at speed. Anybody who stepped out could have been killed. I have friends who are visually impaired and I would not want them to go anywhere near this crossing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 203, West End Lane, West Hampstead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8850329&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
