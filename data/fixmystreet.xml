<title>Multiple lights out on Newington Ct by arches, 31st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8610012</link>
<description>Hello - there are multiple lights out on Newington Ct - the street/alley that runs by the arches between Ministry of Sound and Mercato. It&amp;#39;s very unsafe and I have to use my phone&amp;#39;s light to get through on my way to the shops. Can you please fix the lights? Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 70, Newington Causeway, Elephant and Castle, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8610012&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Multiple streetlights out, cut lights, 31st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8609994</link>
<description>There are multiple street lights out and cut lights all along Rockingham Street by the arches. This a highly used street and also a dangerous area due to all the phone thefts that are occurring. It looks like this has been reported multiple times and the lights have been out for more than six months. Please fix as soon as possible as this is a big safety issue. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8609994.0.jpeg?4a130980&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 119, Newington Causeway, Elephant and Castle, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8609994&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Leaves never get collected in this close, 31st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8609818</link>
<description>The close off Boxgrove Road, which forms part of the adopted highway, is repeatedly and unacceptably neglected during the annual leaf-clearance programme. Each year, this area is overlooked, resulting in significant build-ups of wet leaves, debris, and broken tree branches being left unattended for long periods.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents are routinely forced to step over or walk through these hazardous obstructions simply to access their homes. This creates an entirely avoidable and unacceptable health and safety risk, particularly the risk of slips, trips, and falls, which is further exacerbated in wet or icy conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This ongoing failure to maintain the area places residents at risk of injury and exposes the authority to potential liability should an accident occur. Immediate and urgent action is required to clear the debris and to ensure this close is properly included in all future maintenance and leaf-collection schedules.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8609818.0.jpeg?f6a34503&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Boxgrove Road, Abbey Wood&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8609818&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Potholes/bad access/damaged road/footpath, 31st December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8609789</link>
<description>I am writing to raise concerns regarding the condition of road access to my home at the top of Donkey Alley. Over the approximately six years that we have lived here, access to our property has become increasingly difficult. Donkey Alley is very narrow, and as some residents regularly park along the road, vehicles are often forced to mount the footpath in order to pass. Over time, this has caused the footpath to sink, and both the footpath and road surface have become very uneven and difficult to navigate. There is also a cobbled section of the road that is now significantly damaged, and a large pothole or raised shelf has recently formed. This presents a serious risk of damage to vehicle tyres and suspension and further restricts safe access.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Additionally my mother is blind and although she doesn&amp;#39;t live at the property is makes it very difficult for her to access the property when she&amp;#39;s visiting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to the day-to-day difficulties, I am particularly concerned about emergency access. With cars parked along the alley, it would be extremely difficult — if not impossible — for emergency vehicles such as fire engines or ambulances to reach the homes at the top of the road. Even routine deliveries, including essential items such as topsoil or large household appliances, have been very challenging due to the restricted access. We would therefore like the council to consider repairs to the road surface and footpath, and to explore the introduction of double yellow lines along the narrow section of the alley to prevent parking and ensure safer, more reliable access for residents and emergency services. Thank you for taking the time to consider this matter. I would be happy to provide further details or photographs if required. Kind regards,&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8609789.0.jpeg?1c7b708a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Donkey Alley, East Dulwich, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8609789&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
