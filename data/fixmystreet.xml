<title>Unconfined active construction site with open trenches and construction materials scattered., 12th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286666</link>
<description>The whole length of Beak St was not properly fenced, protected or signed. Pedestrians clambering over open trenches. Construction materials scattered. Accident waiting to happen. Called the Compass Infrastructure emergency phone and got the auto operator with options. Pressed 5 to report an emergency. Engaged. All afternoon. Tried all the other options. All continuously engaged. Given the proximity to one of the UK&amp;#39;s premium tourist assets it was a disgraceful display of poor construction and a health and safety hazard. I am in construction and I have never seen such a bad live site in the UK. UKPN and Compass need to be called out about this urgently.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8286666.0.jpeg?05c7d7de&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 35, Beak Street, City of Westminster&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286666&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Continuous Parking Issue!, 12th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286656</link>
<description>There is a continuous and problematic parking issue on Bourneside Gardens and a safety concern on Primrose Close. There are not enough parking spaces for residents on Bourneside Gardens. Residents and visitors are struggling to park, and vehicles are now parking on grass verges and tight spaces between houses, especially at turning points. This blocks access for others trying to enter or leave their homes and prevents people from turning around. A large silver van is parked long-term and rarely moves. Another work van belonging to a resident at 10 Bourneside Gardens (We believe the tenant is subletting) is parked daily and purposely takes up two spaces adding to the issue. These vehicles are taking up much-needed space. Parking permits were previously considered but shelved – I strongly request that permits are reconsidered to prioritise residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On Primrose Close, there is a white Ford Transit Van (Reg: RO65 CDZ) that has been parked for around six months. A man is living in it. The van has no MOT or tax and he is using gas canisters inside, creating a serious safety risk. It is also impacting the appearance of the area. Please investigate and take appropriate action on both matters. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8286656.0.jpeg?074c7425&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bourneside Gardens, Southend, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286656&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Near International Journal of Excellence in Research, Bloomsbury Way, London WC1A 2SE, 12th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286628</link>
<description>I am writing to make you aware and request urgent Repair of a seriously defective manhole cover located at the junction of Bloomsbury Way and Bury Place, WC1A, near our home.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over recent weeks, the manhole cover has become loose. Each time a vehicle passes over it, it emits a loud clattering sound - so forceful that our house vibrates. The noise is especially bad in the evenings and overnight, when buses frequently pass (often every 5 minutes). It genuinely feels like a train rolling by. The disturbance is severe: it wakes us and our 15-year-old daughter nearly every night.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not just a nuisance - it is disrupting our sleep, affecting our health and wellbeing, and I believe it also presents a safety concern (a loose cover might worsen further under constant load).&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bury Place, Bloomsbury, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286628&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
