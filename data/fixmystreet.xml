<title>There&#39;s a large pothole or other subsidence, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705998</link>
<description>There&amp;#39;s a very large pothole or other subsidence at this location, to the point that it could cause damage to vehicles or, worse, cause (eg) motorcycle riders to come off. I note the previous report but as that&amp;#39;s from last October, it needs reporting again.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Crayford Road, Barnes Cray, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705998&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fly tipping outside St Mungo’s Crimscott Street, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705972</link>
<description>Repeated flytipping on and around the bins that belong to the hostel. The hostel needs support to get a better solution for their bins so that the flytipping problem (which isn’t from the shelter as I understand it) has a chance of stopping.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8705972.0.jpeg?b7ae9566&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 36, Crimscott Street, Old Kent Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705972&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Drain blocked - huge puddle - Valley Rd, 10m SE of jct with Shortlands Rd, Shortlands, South side of the Rd., 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705960</link>
<description>Drain blocked - huge puddle - Valley Rd, 10m SE of jct with Shortlands Rd, Shortlands, South side of the Rd.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On Thu 15/1/26 the puddle was about 6 feet wide by 10 feet long. Today Fri 16/1/26 there is still standing water about 3 feet wide by 6 feet long.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This drain is at the foot of the rising land of Shortlands Rd and Mays Hill Rd.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Autumn leaves have not been cleared. They wash down into this drain making it regularly block.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Neglect and cost avoidance to clear autumn leaves by one part of the Council creates more complex and expensive to clear work for the drainage department of the Council.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please sort out this situation and clear the leaves too in Shortlands Rd and Mays Hill Rd, or the drain will just clog up again.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Valley Road, Shortlands, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705960&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Opposite the Dry Cleaners next to the Alliance pub, 16th January</title>

<description>There is a pot hole the size of a small crater that&amp;#39;s been here at least a year and is getting bigger. This is a road of heavy traffic. Fire engines and buses go past. Every 3 seconds a car hits this pot hole and the walls of my house shake. We are all at our wits end. There are so many reports about this particular pot hole but nothing has been done. Please please fill this pot hole as a matter of urgency&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 32, Mill Lane, West Hampstead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705847&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Debris and Grass Verge Damage, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705829</link>
<description>There is a huge amount of debris left from the building site on 55 Little Birches all the way up from Little Birches to the middle of Harland Avenue making it unsafe to walk with my child on the pavements now because of building site debris (this is not just dirt and rocks but also glass/nails etc). The grass verges are also damaged where they have been swinging their lorries up on the verges along with paving slabs which is dangerous to myself and my child. They should have to hire a road sweeper as part of the planning. Please send a council official/health and safety investigator.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 55, Little Birches, Longlands, Sidcup, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705829&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Marlborough park avenue and burnt oak lane leaf clearance on side of road and pavement, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705792</link>
<description>Slushy leaves everywhere, becoming icy and slippery in the cold. Council have been before but observed sitting in their vans most of the day instead of doing anything! Leaves are all over pavement and side of the road at the burnt oak end of Marlborough park avenue plus burnt oak lane outside of entrance to bruford college/the glades and all along pavement towards Holy trinity school. My child slipped on these today as slushy. When it&amp;#39;s icy its really dangerous!
