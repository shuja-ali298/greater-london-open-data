<title>Pedestrian crossing “wait” button not working at Great Dover Street (by the Roebuck pub). Location (what3words): ///rate.loss.soccer, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8654293</link>
<description>T the pedestrian crossing on Great Dover Street next to the Roebuck pub (what3words: ///rate.loss.soccer), the pedestrian push button / “WAIT” button appears to be faulty. Pressing the button doesn’t register (no response such as the usual confirmation light or beep), and it doesn’t seem to trigger a pedestrian crossing phase.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This means pedestrians may wait unnecessarily or be tempted to cross without a safe signal, increasing the risk of accidents. Please inspect the unit and repair/replace the button mechanism as soon as possible.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 165, Great Dover Street, The Borough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8654293&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Raised pavement reference 850 1702, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8654286</link>
<description>This issue was previously reported under 8501702 and was deemed not within council guidelines for action. See attached photographs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, a council employee visited the area on the 8/1/26 carrying out usual six monthly checks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Separately, he has highlighted this as a potential issue in view of the school? I asked about the residents as well?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, independently he marked the pavement for works and advised this would be fixed to avoid any potential come back to the council in view of the school. I advised that I have previously reported. Due to the persistent rain overnight the markings have removed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please ensure that this pavement is included in the works that are being carried out in the area.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8654286.0.jpeg?b12a11c5&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Witham Road, Anerley, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8654286&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Street lights out in Bermondsey Street tunnel (under London Bridge Station) – dark section creating safety risk., 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8654265</link>
<description>In the Bermondsey Street tunnel under London Bridge Station (what3words: ///roofs.export.linen), a significant number of the tunnel lights are not working – roughly 50% appear to be out. This results in uneven lighting along the tunnel, with a particularly dark section in the middle where visibility drops noticeably.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The poor lighting reduces sightlines and makes it harder for pedestrians and cyclists to see and be seen, especially when approaching from either end. It increases the risk of trips/collisions and creates blind spots that can allow people to remain concealed, which raises personal safety concerns. Please arrange an inspection and repair of the tunnel lighting as a priority.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 33a, Bermondsey Street, The Borough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8654265&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Progressive road cracking Warwick Road, 9th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8654176</link>
<description>Dear Sir/Madam,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to report a deteriorating section of road directly outside my property which appears to be showing signs of progressive cracking and possible subsidence.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have monitored the area over the past two weeks and the cracks have significantly widened and extended during this time. I have attached images taken two weeks apart which clearly demonstrate the progression.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;My concerns are: - Structural weakening of the road surface - Potential subsidence beneath the tarmac - Water ingress into the cracks, accelerating deterioration - Increased risk of potholes forming - Safety risks to pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles - Possible impact on nearby property foundations&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given the visible progression, I kindly request that this section of road is urgently inspected by your highways team, with particular attention to: - Ground stability - Drainage beneath the surface - Risk of further collapse&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please could you confirm: - When an inspection can be arranged - Whether any temporary safety measures will be put in place - The expected timescale for remedial works&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate this being treated as a priority due to the rapid deterioration and safety implications.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your assistance and I look forward to your response.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8654176.0.jpeg?12976324&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Warwick Road, Welling, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8654176&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
