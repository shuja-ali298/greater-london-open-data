<title>Fly tipping in the alleyway, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340851</link>
<description>Lots of bulky waste items have been left in this alley way several weeks (maybe even months) ago. It’s a massive eyesore for those who access their properties via this alley. Additionally there is an overflowing commercial bin.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8340851.0.jpeg?563f6029&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Webb Street, Old Kent Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340851&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Outside of 219 Kilburn lane, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340822</link>
<description>There is rubbish constantly on Kilburn lane, every single day. Every day I walk outside my door there is someone’s bin contents on my door step. The council tax is one of the highest in London and due to this we expect our streets to be clean. I have attached pictures of today’s mess on the street, but it is like this every single day. Please please can something be done about this? I believe it is because some houses do not have wheely bins so they have to put their bin bags on the street and foxes get into them, then the wind blows the rubbish everywhere. This has been an issue since I moved here last December&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8340822.0.jpeg?59f4022c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Kilburn Lane, North Kensington, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340822&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fox - health risk, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340809</link>
<description>A fox consistently manages to get into the basement of Berkeley Court. There are children that have access to the basement. The fox might bite someone if it feels threatened in a confined space risking giving rabies. Foxes also spread disease. Its climbing all over the vehicles in the basement and has been leaving its pee and other waste all over the cars and everywhere in the basement. This can be a health risk for the residents. In addition, there is further risk of eating cables under the vehicle that can have life risking consequences. Ive asked the building management to do something about this but over a year later they have done nothing and now the fox is more at ease to keep returning.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8340809.0.jpeg?b0b9e766&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Glentworth Street, Marylebone, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340809&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>See incident FixMyStreet ref: 8188346&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This issue has become worse because it has been neglected.
