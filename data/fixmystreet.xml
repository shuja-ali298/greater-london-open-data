<title>New street light shining blinding light all through house, 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8474764</link>
<description>A new street light was repaired out the back of our garden yesterday and is producing a blinding light 24 hours a day. We have lived at 5 Brenchley Gardens since March 2025 with no issue. Since this was installed yesterday it is blinding residents with a constant dazzling spotlight that can&amp;#39;t be escaped anywhere downstairs, preventing a toddler and dog from sleeping, creating constant light pollution. It is an unacceptable amount of light to be beaming into our house. Not livable. Needs to be dimmed significantly, preferably removed. At very least it must stop shining into our house and preferably garden. Attached photos were taken at 10pm with all house lights switched off. Totally unacceptable, needs urgent sorting!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8474764.0.jpeg?185c21db&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1-15, Brenchley Gardens, Nunhead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8474764&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Enfield council discrimination, 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8474744</link>
<description>It has been months not weeks since hoppers road, clutch hill, Downes court and green lanes and station road around the broadway pub have been cleaned at all. Bins are not emptied unless they Conservative councillors ask for them to be and my own bins are deliberately now not emptied. N21 have been cleaned at all. I have mitigated my journeys to remain on three roads so I do not see the uncleared filthy on all the other roads. It is targeted behaviour and incredibly frightening as a decision has been made to never clean particular roads, whilst Southgate high street has road cleaners en masse our cleaning every day. In Winchmore Hill we pay council tax, yet are we being targeted for a lessser service, in fact none at all. Concerningly, a senior council member has directly ordered non cleans for Winchmore Hill. Church hill remains a fully ignored road. The published rota is a lie. There is no street cleaning every Wednesday at church hill N21, there is none at all. I will be petitioning all of the residents of church hill over Christmas and focusing on this and the orchard the council have allowed to fe illegally felled without prosecution - much like the Whitewebbs tree. This discrimination is actually a legal offence. The chief executive is fully aware of these actions and complicit. I have nearly collated two months of neighbours ring camera footage on this road, showing no street ckeaner at all.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8474744.0.jpeg?a79aa507&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 55, Church Hill, Southgate, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8474744&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree sapping got run over, 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8474663</link>
<description>I saw one of the small tree saplings with the metal wire around it for it to grow knocked over with the tree fully laying down. Luckily it was small enough for me to get it up right but I feel like a bit of wind would knock it down. If it’s still standing it’s metal structure is all mangled and I’m guessing the tree needs to re replanted or something.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Eastern Way, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8474663&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
