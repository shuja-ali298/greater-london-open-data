<title>Multiple mattresses and furniture fly tipping, 4th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7810986</link>
<description>There have been several items dumped recently that are causing obstruction, health concerns, and general distress for local residents. The most notable items that require urgent removal include: â€¢ A large mattress, dumped right outside my property 247A Croydon Road â€¢ Pieces of furniture, including a sofa, left in alleyway further down that road&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These items have been left for several days and are attracting vermin as well as posing a potential fire and safety hazard.

I am happy to provide photos or further details if required.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your attention to this matter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7810986.0.jpeg?a6398ddd&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bramerton Road, Elmers End, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7810986&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
