<title>Fly tipping, 15th October</title>

<description>Someone local (Gordon H.) — who mostly eats Greggs and drinks Dr Pepper and Lucozade — keeps dropping their bin on Craigerne Road. The garbage then spread across the whole street. It&amp;#39;s disgusting. Can the council take action on behalf of local residents?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8297335.0.jpeg?4d0df952&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 38, Craigerne Road, Kidbrooke, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8297335&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Northwest bound traffic on the A20 being released into Southwood and Green Lane, 15th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8297318</link>
<description>Every few months the sequence of these traffic lights revert to giving northwest bound traffic (i.e. traffic on the southern carriageway) on the A20 only about 3 seconds to cross over into Southwood Road and Green Lane. This then results in a large pile up of cars on the A20 waiting to cross, while all other traffic going straight ahead and turning south have a chance to clear. On many occasions it has taken me upwards of 15 minutes to cross this junction when I try to head north into New Eltham (whereas if I was instead going straight across I would&amp;#39;ve crossed this junction in about a minute).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Apart from lots of traffic congestion, this seems to have further knock-on effects:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1) there are three lanes as you get to the traffic lights. The left lane is for turning left and going straight ahead, the middle lane ONLY for going straight ahead, and the right lane only for crossing the A20. But due to this buildup (of traffic waiting to cross) many road users try to get around it by taking the middle lane and moving into the right lane at the last moment, often unsafely, and dangerously cutting off moving traffic already in the right lane&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2) the above also often leads to those motorists being stuck across the right and middle lanes, so now traffic in the middle lane gets blocked. There&amp;#39;s a slight right-hand kink in the road as you reach the traffic lights, often leaving little chance to see those cars blocking the middle lane until the last moment - also dangerous. And this is a road with a 40MPH speed limit - the risk is just so much higher&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3) it is clear that motorists are getting very frustrated, as not only do they now behave more erratically at the traffic lights, they also drive much more selfishly in the lead up to the traffic lights. Where Felhampton Road meets the A20 there are Keep Clear road markings, to allow traffic from Felhampton Road to be released into the A20. But drivers are getting so selfish that they simply stop in those boxes, either preventing traffic from Felhampton Road getting into the A20 or making it dangerous to do so&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What has worked in the past is for the sequence of lights to allow traffic crossing northbound on the A20 about 10-15 seconds to cross over, i.e. first allowing all traffic on the A20, and then halting traffic heading southeast bound (on the northern carriage-way) for a longer period of time than 3 seconds. This prevents that large buildup of traffic on the southern carriageway stretching back along the A20, and I think it prevents motorists from getting frustrated and behaving erratically and selfishly.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Sidcup Road, New Eltham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8297318&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
