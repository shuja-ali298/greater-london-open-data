<title>Road needs resurfacing, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8814461</link>
<description>Road surfacing very much needed down Watling Street between Gravel Hill roundabout at Erith Rd (Council Office) and Pinnacle Hill. This section, outside two schools, really needs resurfacing. There are large gashes and still some faded painted lines to be renewed and retarmacced. Townley Rd has been done but not this area at all. The whole section of road bothways is dangerous for pedestrians crossing to the schools, especially with children and buggies.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Watling Street, Barnehurst, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8814461&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Street light obscured by tree, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8814459</link>
<description>This street light is at a junction with a alleyway. However, the large tree is blocking most of the light resulting in it being very dark coming along the alleyway onto the footpath. Could you assist the resident with remedial work on the tree or alert them to the issue? It is situated near the broken paving by a small drain (reported earlier) and can be hazardous at night.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8814459.0.jpeg?3e1a36b0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Wallace Close, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8814459&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Unsafe junction for pedestrians and cyclists, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8814416</link>
<description>The road works here highlight how much better this junction would be if it had calming measures like an island or daylighting or speed bumps. It’s in dire need of cycle infrastructure indicating where C11 continues and how to cross Chiswell St both South and Northbound safely. I’ve had several near misses.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 21-24, Chiswell Street, Finsbury, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8814416&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>2ft deep, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8814359</link>
<description>This pothole is a huge safety issue on Baring Road in Grove Park. It is in the SE12 location - on the same road as Baring Road Medical Centre - SE12 ODS. On 30th January in evening, there was extreme rainfall it was very dark and my car collapsed straight into this pot hole. My tyre became completely flat and I could not drive. This has also impacted the safety and other issues of my car. I had to call out RAC and get this fixed immediately as my car was not drivable, posing high risks during these driving conditions. I could not see this pot hole clearly neither could anyone else driving at the same time in the same conditions as me I imagine. This poses extreme danger and safety hazards for all. Please see attached the pictures and videos highlighting this severe road safety hazard. Many other drivers were impacted by this pot hole when I was taking photographic evidence.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8814359.0.jpeg?0977b331&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 286, Baring Road, Chinbrook, Grove Park, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8814359&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The road surface has multiple deep potholes that are causing drivers to swerve. During rainy weather, passing vehicles are frequently flushing water onto pedestrians due to these defects. Additionally the pavement border (kerb) is flaky and deteriorating, creating a significant trip hazard for pedestrians and cars.
