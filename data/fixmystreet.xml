<description>The severity of vibrations continues to increase Prior to G Network&amp;#39;s excavation and the subsequent road repairs, our property experienced no such issues with passing buses. The problem is directly attributable to the inadequate road repairs following the cable installation works.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Request for Action&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given the serious and escalating nature of this issue, I urgently request that Camden Council:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Conduct an immediate inspection of the road defect outside my property Arrange for a structural survey to assess any damage to my property and surrounding homes Undertake comprehensive repairs to properly reinstate the road to its previous condition Provide a timeline for remedial works Confirm liability arrangements for any structural damage caused&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate written acknowledgement of this complaint within 10 working days please, along with details of how Camden Council intends to address this urgent matter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am gravely concerned that without prompt intervention, irreversible structural damage will occur, potentially compromising the safety and stability of my home and those of my neighbours. I trust you will treat this matter with the urgency it warrants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am available to discuss this matter further and to facilitate site inspections at your earliest convenience. Please do not hesitate to contact me on the details provided above.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I look forward to your prompt response.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yours faithfully, Alexander Dawood&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 76, Canfield Gardens, South Hampstead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8271428&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The no right turn sign for the phobited no right turn from Shaftesbury avenue into mercer street Travelling northbound is in the wrong position Cars are turning right as the sign is on the opposite side of the road where car drivers possibly would not see it it in their immmediate view No doubt the council is issuing fines which is illegal and no doubt contrary to the fact itâ€™s being used as a cash cow The sign should be placed on the east pavement where it can be seen or on the crossing warning drivers This in itself is a failure by the council to provide proper signage If nothing gets done I feel this will be one for the press to publish&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): St. Giles Passage, Bloomsbury, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8271411&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

This happens all the time. Then the foxes tear up those bags or whatever they leave behind, and it spills all over the entrance.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 164, Bellenden Road, Peckham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8271299&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
