<title>Fly tipping in communal garden, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8640217</link>
<description>I am reporting a large rubbish pile in the shared communal front garden on our road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This land is communal and part of social housing, not private land belonging to me. All properties on the road share this front garden.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pile started small but has grown significantly because unknown neighbours have been dumping their own items there. I have not placed this waste there myself and I do not have control over who uses the area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am disabled (ADHD) and currently on benefits, and I am not financially or physically able to arrange private waste removal. The rubbish is becoming an eyesore and is causing distress, as well as potential health and safety concerns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can this be treated as fly-tipping on communal land and arranged for removal. I would also appreciate any steps that can be taken to prevent further dumping in this area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your help.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Westhorne Avenue, Eltham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8640217&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Ceres Road and Kashgar Road is fly tippers ground. These refuse sacks are blocking pavement and it is spreading filth everywhere. Any chance this corner can have a camera to monitor te street both ways and corners. It is a path used by children and parents for school run every day. There is not a single day this road is clean.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8640214.0.jpeg?f8c9b3c3&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Ceres Road, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8640214&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Highway issue regarding curr3nt upgrading of water/gas mains, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8640069</link>
<description>Their caged off area is in a very dangerous position and on double yellow lines. It should be moved further into the Crescent adjacent to the wall between No 2a and the main entrance to Cold Blow Crescent. There have already been two dangerous incidents one when the spoil lorry was blocking the entrance and trying to manoeuvre. There was also spoil left on the road. I cannot believe how any sane person could have sanctioned this especially as the double yellow lines were put there in the first place to alleviate problems. I also suggest that no parking cones are placed to stop parking up to 2a - none of these cars, vans and lorries belong to CBC residents. Thank you for hopefully a speedy response.
