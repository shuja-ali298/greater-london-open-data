<title>Antisocial behaviour lime bike.You have decided or have struct a deal with the Lime bike company allocating 3 car parking spaces in Osborne road which is an absolute nightmare for the residents. How can you justify this decision taking up car space for Lime bikes that pay no insurance, no road tax, and not paying for car parking permit like I am, why are privileged. This is also causing ASB especially at the weekend. Why have Hackney council given Lime preferential treatment I am sick of moving these bikes out of my way because of the outrages decision you&#39;ve made. I have been a resident in Osborne road for 25 years and never experience such disruption. I have always owned a car and I have always paid from 2012 for a parking permit yet the nuisance bike get everything for free. I have asked in the pass to have a designated parking space with a very valid reason and guess what you refused but, now you give LIME BIKES FREE Parking which is causing a nuisance. Whoever, thought this was a good idea perhaps you should have this going on outside your own home and see how you like it. Lastly they are also leaving bikes near peoples cars I came out one day to find a bike learning on peoples cars. I THINK YOU SHOULD REMOVE THIS IDEA IMMEDIATELY. Other boroughs are scrapping them completed because of the nuisance these bikes are causing is seen on TV las week. Good morning Britain. I will be showing pictures of these bikes on Good Morning Britian and explaing to them what an issue it is causing in this cul-da-sac . The users leave the bikes anywhere they feel like it, I have had to personally move bikes in order to get passed when driving my car and when walking out of my front door. Friday and Saturday nights are worse than a week day. Is there a deal thats been made with the company to allow this prefe., 28th October</title>
