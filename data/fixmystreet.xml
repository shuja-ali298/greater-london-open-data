<title>Flooding in garage area, 14th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8916106</link>
<description>Two soak away drains need unblocking, taking forever, days in fact to soak away any water from the near constant rain we have had of late, resulting in the garage area being flooded. Not helped I guess by the nearby building site and the run off of mud from that.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Sewell Road, Abbey Wood&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8916106&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Street signage for Ringo is too low on poles and could cause injury, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8915740</link>
<description>Sadly, ever since Ringo signs were placed on Station Square and along Fairway they have been too low to the ground according to the UK Department for Transport Traffic Signs Manual which&amp;#39; require the standard mounting height for traffic signs is at least 2.15 meters from the lowest edge of the sign to the ground on footways&amp;#39;, The good reason is apparent from the photographs, someone who is even on 1.52 meters in height could be seriously injured walking side on into these plates. I suggest that a safety audit of all these signs be undertaken and remedial action be taken as a matter of some urgency.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8915740.0.jpeg?42867b35&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 13, Fairway, Poverest, Orpington, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8915740&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
