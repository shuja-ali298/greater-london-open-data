<title>Litter Bin, 29th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950533</link>
<description>Email received by CSC inbox 29/07/25 08:04&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Please give brief details of your complaint or compliment below: The litter bin on Cameron Road, Bromley is constantly overflowing with litter and dog waste bags.The bin is situated right next to bus stop G and it absolutely stinks! Can you install a dog waste bin nearby which will elevate the problem? Also can the bin be emptied more frequently as the content are often spewed all over the nearby pavement creating a pest control problem. • What action (if any) would you like us to take? Install a dog waste bin &amp;amp; empty the litter bin more frequently&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cameron Road, Hayes, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950533&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bins left on the street where pedestrians are meant to walk, 29th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950513</link>
<description>People are always leaving their black general waste bins outside the boundaries of their properties even on days when there is no bin collection from the council. It blocks the pathway, smells disgusting and a form of visual pollution!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Olinda Road, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950513&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Safety hazard, 29th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950494</link>
<description>Email received by CSC inbox 28/07/25 20:42&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to formally raise a complaint regarding a serious safety hazard I encountered on the pavement outside Clarks shoe shop on Beckenham High Street. On Saturday 26th July 2025, I tripped over a metal pole that had been cut down but was still protruding dangerously from the pavement. While there were some ground markings, there were no warning signs, cones, or barriers in place to alert pedestrians to the obstruction or its height. As a direct result of this hazard, I sustained a painful cut to my toe caused by the exposed metal. The injury led to excessive bleeding (photographic evidence attached), and I required treatment at urgent care, where the wound was cleaned and I also received a tetanus injection, and I also fainted in the process! The incident caused huge discomfort and inconvenience. Staff at Clarks shoe shop promptly assisted me at the scene. They helped clean the wound using antibacterial wipes and provided initial bandaging. They may also be willing to provide a witness statement, should one be required. It is my understanding that Bromley Council is responsible for maintaining the safety of public pavements. The presence of this unmarked hazard — especially in a high-footfall area — indicates a failure in the Council’s duty of care. I am requesting a full investigation into the incident, including any prior reports or works logged for that location, and immediate action to make the area safe. Please be advised that I am currently considering legal action in respect of this injury and the Council’s negligence in maintaining a safe environment for pedestrians. I therefore request that this complaint be formally recorded and that you preserve all relevant r&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 161, High Street, Beckenham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950494&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Carpet dumped in my council bin, 29th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950474</link>
<description>Someone has dumped a large quantity of carpet into my council black bin, leaving no space for me to put anything else in the bin. This was done while the bin was on the street overnight for collection. I have pulled the bin back round onto my property, immediately behind the wall.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7950474.0.jpeg?1b8c5ba9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 204, Shooters Hill Road, Charlton, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950474&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Outside of Hornby Close 17, 29th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950461</link>
<description>The pothole has been there since we moved in April and is in the centre of the road. It causes my house to shake heavily when trucks or buses drive over it. Parked cars force traffic towards the road centre, meaning vehicles frequently hit the pothole, especially at night. This is a safety hazard and is causing structural concerns for my property due to constant vibrations.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Alexandra Road, South Hampstead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7950461&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
