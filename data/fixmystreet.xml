<description>Potholes and irregular road surface along the entire stretch of Stadium road between Baker Road and Charlton church lane - the majority of the larger potholes are over 3&amp;quot; deep and are located outside the carparks and the entrance to the hospital, adjacent to the zebra crossings, the road itself at these points is also in poor condition with wheel ruts and undulations all presenting trip and fall hazards, given this is the main route from the car park to the hospital where people with disabilities are having to walk is totally unnacceptable also ambulances are having to use this route and crashing into the potholes with patients aboard - this along with the continual flooding at the north end of Stadium Rd as the gullies are blocked is all totally unnacceptable and needs fixing before there is a serious accident either with a car or pedestrians please fix it before someone is seriously injured&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Stadium Road, Woolwich&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8810076&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overturned bin, 31st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8809947</link>
<description>This litter bin is always overflowing with rubbish. The litter is scattered around. We think that people overturn it on purpose. We have seen people looking for something into the bin, perhaps they hide drugs in it? Please you have to clean the rubbish and remove the bin, as this is an ongoing issue.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8809947.0.jpeg?f81b1c85&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Wickham Lane, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8809947&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Outside 227 Camden High Street, 31st January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8809940</link>
<description>The Council invested £££ in a drainage system for the “Square”on the pedestrianised part of Camden High Street - with ducting along the sides of the road under a raised road surface. This has drain inlets at each end. The drain inlet or the ducting itself is blocked. There is permanent and deep standing water across half of the roadway. The drainage system is not fit for purpose This is a major issue for pedestrians who generally don’t wear wellingtons or waders to visit Camden. If (when) we have a cold snap this will freeze and become a safety risk.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 227, Camden High Street, Chalk Farm, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8809940&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
