<title>34 York Way - Camden Street Light cable diversion, 19th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8955371</link>
<description>Hi, I am working of behalf of my client to deliver the Highway Works which are part of the S106 planning obligations for Islington Council Planning App. No. P2023/0381/S73. The required Highway Works are for the widening of a 12m length of the existing loading bay outside Jahn Court, 34 York Way, London, N1 9AB. Google Streetview: https://maps.app.goo.gl/BMkkZa5RHtkhEk4m7 The proposed levels of the widened loading bay are to match the existing footway levels. However, I have identified from the GPR utility survey that your apparatus is likely to affected by the construction of the proposed flush granite edge kerb, due to the shallow depth of your apparatus in the footway at this location. I am therefore proposing a diversion of your apparatus as shown on attached drawing 9025-JCL-RGP-XX-XX-DR-C-0102. • Could you please confirm if our Contractor can undertake these proposed works to your apparatus, and your construction requirements? • Else, can you please provide a C3 budget estimate for the proposed diversion works shown? Please let me know if you need any additional information or if you have any questions.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Euston Road, King&#39;s Cross, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8955371&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>I reported this problem with dog excrement along the length of our road yesterday and the ticket was closed as resolved. Clearly it was not looked at as all of the excrement is still there today. I have photographed 5 lots of excrement on the right hand side of the road (walking towards Croydon road) and attempted to send the photos but they will not upload. Please can you revisit and check and clear both sides of the pavements as this is a public health hazard with mothers with prams and small children with bikes &amp; scooters constantly visiting the popular nursery at the top of Thornsett road., 19th February</title>

<title>Fly tipping and dumped rubbish, 19th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8955155</link>
<description>There is a piece of land between 9 and 11 Kelsey Park Road (KPR) which is a major health risk to local residents, and in particular, to the adjacent dental surgery at 11 Kelsey Park Road. This area is currently being used as parking for the flats above the shops at 1 to 9 KPR and for the shop owners/customers as well. The shops and flats above at 1 to 9 KPR and the piece of land is owned by one landlord. The manager of the estate agents at 3-5 KPR, Langford Russell, has confirmed this to me but refused to disclose to me who the landlord was or give contact details. This piece of land is an absolute disgrace. It is filthy, covered in rubbish, and occupied by vermin. Open rubbish bags are strewed across the ground and fly-tipping is a regular occurrence. There are also piles of flattened cardboard boxes and several wooden pallets that are dumped. On the site are two 4-wheeled wheelie bins, and three 2-wheelied wheelie bins. Very occasionally only one of the 4-wheeled wheelie bins is emptied, but none of the other wheelie bins are ever touched. They are consequently full and over-flowing with stinking rubbish. The emptying of the 4-wheeled wheelie bin happens roughly once every 4-6 weeks and it is always bursting out of the top with rubbish due to its infrequent collection. What makes the rubbish problem significantly worse is the fact that this land is right in the middle of the Beckenham Town Conservation Area and the awful mess is clearly visible from the pavement. The land looks, and is, disgusting. I have lived adjacent to this piece of land for 47 years and I have never seen it satisfactorily cleared or cleaned. The council has the legal powers to do something about this and to force the landlord to clear it up.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8955155.0.jpeg?7109e112&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 11, Kelsey Park Road, Beckenham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8955155&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
