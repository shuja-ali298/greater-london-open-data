<title>Not enough bins for residents. Constantly overflowing, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779977</link>
<description>X2 bins for x21 flats. Bins always overflowing into communal refuse space. Rubbish smell seeps into residential building, common foyer, corridors and private flats. Smells terrible. Building management refuse to accept smell or deal with issue.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Powell Road, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779977&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>New paper and cardboard bins in Penge East car Park are overflowing, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779967</link>
<description>New Silver paper and cardboard bins in Penge East car Park are overflowing And serve no purpose where they were placed. These new silver bins are new. probably the council thought to place them here to help people not flytip. However they seem to be defeating the objects as as you can see from the photos, people are not actually using the green recycling banks and anymore and rather filling these new bins up, overflowing them and then flytipping the rest of their recycling on the ground. The situation was much better when we only had the green recycling banks. The new silver bins are blocking a free space to use the green recycling banks and making the space tight for someone to stand up to use the green recycling banks without tripping. The new silver bins are a real tripping hazard. This site should be clear at all times according to the council’s code of practice. Could you please arrange to remove these new silver bins as soon as possible. The residents were not consulted about placing them and we will have to seek legal action against the council if they are removed immediately. By placing these new bins here the council is allowing for more flytipping and being part of it. They are simply not helping but rather making the site look like a dumpster.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7779967.0.jpeg?85e05fe8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Station Road, Penge, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779967&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Numerous cars parked illegally on road, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779964</link>
<description>There are a number of cars that repeatedly park illegally on the west parkside road next to the Souther Park in North Greenwich area - they are parked on double yellow lines (at present there are 12 cars parked there).&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This problem has been persistent for about 6-9 months now (since the social housing building adjacent to the road started operating). But gets worse and worse every day&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is becoming more hazardous by the day as more cars park there and it is extremely difficult to see the road when crossing as a pedestrian.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fines seems to be ignored (when they are placed on cars), something more fundamental needs to be done to prevent the parking there. Some kind of blocks to parking or clamping/towing should be implemented.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7779964.0.jpeg?ab948552&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 35, West Parkside, East Greenwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779964&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

All around this light column and next to the big oak tree brambles, nettles and tree growth are spilling to the narrowest part of the footpath used by thousands of schoolchildren and residents everyday. They scratch all passersby and make them step on the very busy road.
