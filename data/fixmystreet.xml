<description>The latest local problems reported by users</description>
<language>en-gb</language>

<item>
<title>Social housing residents descended on their local council yesterday after &quot;years&quot; of frustration over disrepair came to a head when their entire Hackney block lost hot water. On Thursday (July 10) protesters from Fellows Court estate in Hackney came to the Town Hall&#39;s front door in the 29 degree heat, demanding urgent action over flooding, mould, and faulty temporary boilers in the social housing block.Resident Dave Coleman told the Local Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS) that after days of contacting the council and posting on social media about the &quot;dire&quot; hot water failures, the inhabitants were told last week that temporary showers would be installed in the building&#39;s courtyard on Saturday, July 5.But there were no workmen to be seen until Tuesday,&quot; he said. &quot;The showers were ready by Wednesday, but then yesterday they were shut.&quot; Meanwhile, two 47kg gas cans had &quot;dangerously&quot; been left outside the washrooms, which Mr Coleman said were not properly secured. &quot;It&#39;s putting residents at risk. Anyone could just walk in,&quot; he said. We will be pursuing further action for Fellows Court members and we will continue fighting until their demands are met. We won&#39;t stop until each of our members has safe, secure and well maintained housing,&quot; said ACORN&#39;s Kane Newman. Mr Coleman added that his flat had flooded at least three times in the last ten months, but the problems affecting the block&#39;s north tower stretched back to 2023. &quot;I&#39;m so sick and tired of it,&quot; he said.Cathy Purdy, who has lived on the 16th floor for 35 years, told the LDRS she &quot;didn&#39;t have it too bad, but I despair for the people on the lower floors&quot;. She added that Mayor of Hackney Caroline Woodley had previously visited the estate due to the persistent issues. &quot;She told us it made her weep to hear our stories. But that&#39;s as far as it gets,&quot; Ms Purdy said.In a letter seen by the LDRS, the local authority told residents that while their hot water was down, they would have access to showers in the borough&#39;s Better Leisure Centres. But Sara Tinoco, who has lived in the building for 28 years, questioned this as a solution for elderly residents whose nearest health club was a 15-minute walk away. She described the building&#39;s general state, with water &quot;everywhere&quot;, as &quot;just terrible&quot;. Another resident, Rosangela De Faria, told the LDRS she had not invited her friends to her home for two years due to the block becoming &quot;so dirty and ugly.Mr Coleman added that Hackney&#39;s Housing Director, Steve Waddington, had &quot;repeatedly promised a deep clean. That has never happened&quot;. Meanwhile, tenants said many parcels and packages had been stolen from the building in the absence of round-the-clock security, which came to an end after the concierge&#39;s office ceiling collapsed in 2023.The protesters were joined by ACORN renters union, who slammed the &quot;inhumane&quot; conditions they were living with, and handed them red high-vis jackets to wear as they chanted &quot;fix our block&quot; on the Town Hall&#39;s doorstep. Meanwhile, a few tenants and campaigners went inside with the hope of securing commitments from the council for urgent major works, and to arrange a formal meeting between the local authority and the union. They did not succeed.A Hackney Council spokesperson said: &quot;We are doing everything we can to resolve the serious ongoing issues affecting residents at Fellows Court and sincerely apologise for the disruption and distress this has caused. &quot;We expect hot water to be reinstated to the building early next week. Following this, we will carry out further testing on the risers that supply hot water to each floor and carry out any necessary repairs to ensure full service is restored to all residents as quickly as possible.&quot;, 12th July</title>

<title>Hire bike overcrowding compromises pedestrian safety, 12th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7865626</link>
<description>The bike parking at the roundabout near Warrington Crescent and Sutherland road is generally overflowing. The excess bikes compromise the crossing of pedestrians at this crossing as drivers sight lines are impacted. This is a disaster waiting to happen. Not only do the number of bikes parked need to be enforced it is a far better solution to move this parking area AWAY from the crossing (down to the other end of the hatched area). There is plenty of room to do this. Safety of pedestrians, especially because the roundabout is right next to a primary school!!, should be the priority.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7865626.0.jpeg?f5e5cd41&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Sutherland Avenue, Maida Vale, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7865626&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Scrubs all cut back next to my fence/boundary, 12th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7865563</link>
<description>After requests to the friends of the park to not cut all of the strubery away from my border next to pickhurst Green they have done it creating an unecessary second path that is not needed and only is used by people on motorbikes. It is not wide enough for a normal path. It does however provide access to my fence and affects the security of my house. I’ve already been burgled once by somebody jumping over this fence. I cannot see any right of way or bridal path requirements so can somebody please explain if they have any rights to do this and what are mine as the owner of the house. Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7865563.0.jpeg?c1b365ef&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pickhurst Lane, Hayes, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7865563&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
