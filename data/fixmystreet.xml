<title>Rubbish dumped, 18th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8566069</link>
<description>At 16:58 on 18/12/2025, an occupant (female, dark hair tied back, wearing sweater top &amp;amp; joggers bottoms) of 22 Draycott Avenue, was banging a black plastic bin onto the pavement &amp;amp; rubbish fell out onto the pavement. The same woman went into the rear of 22 Draycott Avenue to fetch a broom that she used to sweep the rubbish into the edge of the road &amp;amp; pavement &amp;amp; returned to the rear of 22 Draycott Avenue using the alleyway. That back alleyway (that runs along the back of numbers 18 to 24 Draycott Avenue) is used by some of those occupants to take rubbish out, usually for collecting by refuse collectors NOT to dump rubbish as the described woman did. It is unacceptable for health, safety &amp;amp; environmental reasons to dump rubbish out onto the public highways.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8566069.0.jpeg?ac0d7a9c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Rosemoor Street, Chelsea, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8566069&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pothole, 18th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8566064</link>
<description>A utility company previously dug up the road and the council carried out some patchwork repairs on previous potholes. All of this work was carried out to a low standard causing more potholes in between the patchwork of repairs and poor utility work. Combined with increased traffic from Thames Water closing Bromley Common frequently potholes are occurring.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8566064.0.jpeg?7e2748e0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Mosslea Road, Southborough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8566064&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Potholes, 18th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8566050</link>
<description>Previously works were carried out on this road to lay two pipes. At the location of these two pipes pot holes are developing as when the roadway was relaid it was completed badly and with a completely different material type. All that needs to happen is put a border of liquid tarmac between the old roadway and the new roadway to prevent this but it never happens. The pipe is laid the quickest cheapest roadway is laid by the utility company and the inevitable potholes are left to the council. If only they improved the specifications of roadway repairs by utility companies and checked it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8566050.0.jpeg?2dd3c243&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Victoria Road, Southborough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8566050&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Re-laid slabs loose, 18th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8565998</link>
<description>There were recent works on this pavement do broad band. The paving slabs were removed for the works and relaid. Unfortunately they have been relaid without being flat and without a sand cement mix in between so they are now loose and uneven. The last photo shows flat safe paving at the same location which was not removed for the works. The broad band company need to return to fix rather than the Bromley taxpayer.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8565998.0.jpeg?cddfc9ea&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Waverley Close, Southborough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8565998&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

During busy periods, this causes traffic to build up, as the bus lane cannot be used effectively.
