<title>Request for zebra crossing outside school, 6th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8386535</link>
<description>Would it be possible for the council to consider installing a zebra crossing and dropped curbs to Church Road, immediately outside Uplands School?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At peak times, it is quite dangerous to cross with children, especially when travelling with a buggy, or toddlers on scooters. This is not helped by parents parking in no parking zones.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Church Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8386535&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Manhole broken, 6th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8386372</link>
<description>This manhole is broken now at least 4 months.. it has been reported by myself and a neighbour of mine many times but we always get a “fixed “reply back to us. This is REALLY affecting all our sleep and it is actually keeping my kids awake at night as they cannot sleep with this constant banging ALL night. We urgently need this fixed as it is a huge nuisance to us all. Please do not give us a reply fixed back.. yous have to come out and hear this constant banging for yourselves as we are all getting very frustrated with all this. We await you. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8386372.0.jpeg?85af84c5&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Chester Way, Kennington, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8386372&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>All along the river path the trees are overgrown and blocking out the street lights. I&amp;#39;ve lived on Montana Gardens for over 13 years and I&amp;#39;ve never seen this area so badly neglected! Bromley council and First Port management company are supposed to be maintaining this path and river bank but neither are doing anything! Have I got to go down to the river path and maintain it myself?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8386354.0.jpeg?867a5e40&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Montana Gardens, New Beckenham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8386354&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Highgate High Street at junction of South Grove, 6th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8386301</link>
<description>The closure of one lane of traffic on Highgate High Street where it meets South Grove, with temporary traffic lights restricting the traffic flow, is completely unnecessary and has been causing huge problems in Highgate for the past couple of weeks. The work is actually at least 10 metres away on South Grove, and there is no reason for the partial closure of the High Street. I spoke to someone working there today and even he couldn’t understand why the High Street was restricted. He just said the council asked for it. I beg you to come and see for yourself - the congestion backs up right through Highgate down towards Archway and spills on to surrounding roads, the schools add to the congestion, no-one can get through Highgate, the buses are delayed, there is terrible pollution caused by all the idling cars, and no-one here can understand why the lane is closed. Please reopen the High Street as soon as possible. I would be very happy to talk to you about this if you have time to call me.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 35, Highgate High Street, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8386301&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
