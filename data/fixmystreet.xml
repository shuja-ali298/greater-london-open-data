<title>Traffic light pedestrian crossing &#39;wait&#39; buttons intermittently not working, 21st June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741676</link>
<description>I have noticed over the past few days that the buttons at the traffic light cross roads by New Eltham Station are intermittently not working.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I first noticed it crossing from Pope Street to Post Office. I initially thought it was just one faulty button. But this morning crossing from Chattertons towards the bridge and this afternoon crossing from the bridge towards Chattertons the buttons did the same.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This morning we had to push the button multiple times and quite hard to make it illuminate the &amp;#39;wait&amp;#39; light. Then this afternoon we&amp;#39;d pressed the button but the green man did not come on during that sequence, so we had to wait and keep pressing it to be able to cross.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;At other points during the day when I crossed the buttons have worked fine with no issues, so it seems to be an intermittent fault. But it is quite frustrating, especially when on the school run. We can&amp;#39;t cross at our usual crossing at the moment due to road works, so we are reliant on being able to safely cross at these lights to get to school/home. I have diligently taught my children about waiting for the green man and safely crossing the road, so crossing on a red man would really disrupt the routine and expectations for my SEN children.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 5, Southwood Road, New Eltham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741676&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Raised access hatch/paving slab, 21st June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741669</link>
<description>This has been an issue for at least 2mths. The solution seems to be surrounding it with these barriers which have been laying on the ground since day one creating a hazard to cover the original hazard.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;(Fish roundabout/old townhall corner) Can you do something reasonable about the problem please?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7741669.0.jpeg?a70386f4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Walnut Tree Road, Northumberland Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741669&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree stump overgrown blocking pavement, 21st June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741654</link>
<description>Hiya, the street tree outside #2 Dovedale was cut down previously (I believe about a year ago?). The stump has become so overgrown it is now impossible to use the pavement to walk around it. While the road is fairly peaceful and quiet, it is an obstruction and I&amp;#39;ve seen numerous people stop when they see it and walk in the road to go around the cars parked next to it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7741654.0.jpeg?97ceb401&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 17, Dovedale Close, Welling, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7741654&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
