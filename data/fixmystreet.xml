<title>Multiple potholes in estate Road, 19th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8956143</link>
<description>Once again multiple deep potholes in estate road. This is a reoccurring problem - the holes get filled and then they crack again very easily. This is damaging cars and not safe for those walking to their cars either. When it rains the whole strip of road ends up filling up with water and a huge puddle is made. The whole road needs completely relaying and levelling.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8956143.0.jpeg?16e268f2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bullace Row, Camberwell, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8956143&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Concerns Regarding Traffic Light Operation at A10/M25 Roundabout, 19th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8956003</link>
<description>Dear Sir or Madam,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to raise concerns regarding the operation of the traffic lights at the A10/M25 roundabout.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Over several recent evenings, I have observed traffic at a complete standstill while navigating the roundabout. During these periods, a number of drivers appeared to become frustrated and began proceeding through red lights. As a result, vehicles blocked the exits between successive signal phases, preventing traffic from clearing properly before the next set of lights changed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This pattern of vehicles entering and obstructing the junction seemed to occur across multiple approaches, which in turn caused significant congestion. On each occasion, the backlog extended some distance along the A10 in both directions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to reviewing the signal timings, I would suggest consideration be given to installing red light enforcement cameras at the junction. The presence of cameras that detect and penalise drivers who proceed through red signals may act as a deterrent. This could improve compliance, reduce unsafe manoeuvres, and help prevent the gridlock that occurs when vehicles block the junction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would be grateful if this matter could be reviewed to determine whether adjustments or enforcement measures may be appropriate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yours faithfully, YK&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Waltham Cross Interchange, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8956003&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
