<description>I was just walking moments ago along the Bromley Road and nearly tripped and fell over this unsafe manhole drain cover full stop it appears to be blocked underneath but the metal appears to be bent upwards and therefore it is easy to trip over. Please can you come out as soon as possible and replace it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7956326.0.jpeg?de49a34e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 49, Bromley Road, Beckenham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7956326&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Rubbish not collected left here for weeks, 30th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7956302</link>
<description>This rubbish on Walworth Road outside Tankard pub - presumably from the pub? Has either not been collected or isn’t supposed to be there. It’s been there for at least a week - attracting more rubbish and litter. It is really depressing as a resident to walk past this every day. Can it be removed and there be an investigation into why it is there if it is not supposed to be and if dumping rubbish on the pavement is how it is put out for collection can levels of service be improved to make sure it doesn’t just sit there or some other arrangement be considered.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7956302.0.jpeg?5a6d75ad&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 178, Walworth Road, Elephant and Castle, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7956302&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Someone is disposing of organic waste in the bin meant for non-recyclable and non-organic waste, 30th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7956214</link>
<description>There has been a persistent strong odor of organic waste coming from the trash bin located at the entrance of Shere House, apartments 24 to 31. Although this bin is designated ONLY for non-organic and non-recyclable waste, someone appears to be disposing of organic waste there. It would be advisable to put up a notice or, alternatively, check the security cameras to see what is happening. The smell is very unpleasant, attracts flies, and negatively affects the health of residents.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Great Dover Street, The Borough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7956214&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Poor Cleaning Conditions in the Common Areas of Shere House (Apartments 24 to 31), 30th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7956183</link>
<description>The internal common areas of the apartment block covering units 24 to 31 at Shere House are in poor condition — dirty and with insufficient cleaning maintenance. In front of some of the apartments, there are heavy dirt stains, apparently from placing rubbish bags, as well as visible trails of dripping waste along the staircases. These stains have not been properly cleaned and are now forming permanent marks throughout the building, in addition to causing an unpleasant odor.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Furthermore, the windows are dirty and covered in cobwebs, and the walls also show cobwebs and some mold spots. To make matters worse, it seems that one of the apartments is undergoing renovation, and the common areas have been left with sand, white dust, and nails scattered on the floor — all clear signs that cleaning maintenance has been poor. The staircases, walls, windows, floors, apartment entrances, and handrails are all in need of a deep cleaning. This situation seems to result mainly from insufficient maintenance and, possibly, from some residents not fully cooperating in keeping the shared areas clean. It would be nice if a polite notice to be circulated to all residents, kindly reminding them to help maintain the common areas in good condition and to take extra care when disposing of rubbish, ensuring that waste is not spilled or dripped on the stairs. Unfortunately, this careless practice has become somewhat common and contributes to making the shared spaces unsanitary.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7956183.0.jpeg?71184375&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Great Dover Street, The Borough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7956183&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
