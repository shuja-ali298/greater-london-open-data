<title>Litter picking is needed along Talfourd Rd, 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8896771</link>
<description>Please send a team to litter pick along Talfourd road on a regular basis. I saw that litter was picked twice in 2025. Please could litter picking be done at least once a week (preferably on Wednesday afternoons after the refuse and garden waste collections). In the past this was the approach (once weekly litter pick, timed appropriately) but has declined to approximately twice a year. The location is all of Talfourd road. the issue has been present for a number of years and the care for this street has been in general decline. Thank you in advance.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 31, Talfourd Road, Peckham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8896771&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
