<title>Why is Ruskin avenue neglected??, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8664016</link>
<description>Ruskin avenue is neglected!! I have never seen a road sweeper in the years that I have lived here but regularly I see them daily on the main road and other side streets.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;My property is near an alleyway with flats above the commercial units below. Thy don’t have use of any bins that I know of and use mine and my neighbours bins so when we go to take waste out the bins are already full. The area outside our door has become a dumping ground with regular missed re cycle collections, rats attacking bags on floor as no space in bins and people dumping old items like suitcases etc. we need a road sweeper and some control of fly ripping by people behind the shops to have their own bins so they so they don’t discard their rubbish outside our properties&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8664016.0.jpeg?317d244c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ruskin Avenue, Welling, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8664016&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>15 inch pothole, 10th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8663886</link>
<description>I was driving on the north circular on the 08/01/26 at 11.30am when my car hit a very big pothole. My tyre on the left passenger side got a massive hole to the point where I had to come off the north circular and pull into a petrol station in Palmers Green. This could have caused a massive accident if I didn’t act quickly? I then had to go to a tyre place to have my spare tyre put on. I then managed to drive back home in south London witch took me 3 hours to get home due to doing only 30mph I then had to go and pay £200 for a new tyre which I found done by as my tyre was fairly new? Unfortunately I couldn’t stop to take any photos due to location on the north circular as there wasn’t anywhere I could stop as it’s on the dual carriage way with cars driving very fast…? I hope you can locate the hole so hopefully no one gets involved in a car crash or anyone else experiencing what I just gone through? Hopefully I would hear from you soon Thanks Claire Georgiou Car reg is C2ERY also hopefully you have cameras and would be able to see my car going through at this time and location when it happened&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Advent Way, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8663886&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
