<title>Multiple potholes, 3rd December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8498598</link>
<description>So there are multiple potholes on this road. A huge amount of them are very close to the park and also if you carry on going ,from the park in the direction of North Finchley along the road, there’s lots more. They’ve been doing a lot of work on the road in terms of pipework and they’ve also added some speed bumps. But it just doesn’t make sense that they’ve added the speed bumps, as clearly no one has actually assessed the quality of the road first. What should’ve happened is the road should’ve been resurfaced and then the speed bumps put down. Because obviously when they do resurface the road, they are going yo have to remove the speed bumps that they’ve just put down in order to do it. And this road needs not just the potholes filling , in it needs resurfacing. It’s so very very bad and only gonna get worse during the winter. It has so many potholes you just lose count. But in the meantime, what they should’ve done is filled in the potholes. They’ve been working on so much of the road and yet ignored the potholes completely. There are speed bumps right next to potholes that they could’ve filled in, but just haven’t. Why couldn’t they just have brought a bit more tarmac with them to do that at the same time. Surely once they started the work they could’ve reported the potholes , and the following day brought more tarmac to do that as well , Crazy! The road was closed off and is still closed off now for work. Its all been causing absolute mayhem/ congestion on Friern Barnet Lane but they’re not utilising the road being closed!! Surely the whole point of looking after the roads is to be as efficient with the workload as possible to reduce unnecessary expenditure…. Also just to add that Friary road is a very busy through road , lots of daily traffic, and acts almost like a B Road. It’s not a quiet side road at all. It’s incredibly busy , hence the potholes. Another road that’s not quite as busy as this , but very similar in terms of traffic, is Buxted Road which is another road off Friern Barnet Lane - that acts as a through road and is very busy , again with multiple potholes that needs resurfacing. But let’s start with Friary Road. And then maybe you could tackle Buxted Road afterwards. thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8498598.0.jpeg?de0e9c9b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Friary Road, North Finchley, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8498598&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
