<title>Vehicle access during church street market operational hours., 9th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8142543</link>
<description>Roadworks on Salisbury road are currently in operation,therefore church street has been opened to motorists. I have received several complaints from customers and traders regarding the matter. This is causing significant congestion and also endangering pedestrians that are shopping at the market. I urge highways to review the opening of church street market during trading hours as I believe an accident to a pedestrian is likely to occur.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8142543.0.jpeg?3c2a63f8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 32, Salisbury Street, St. John&#39;s Wood, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8142543&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Black-top bin at 4 Dalton Terrace filled with rotting waste left by others before our move-in (25 Aug); bin repeatedly rejected for collection despite our compliance with rules., 9th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8142386</link>
<description>Dear Council Team,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We moved into our new home 4 Dalton Terrace on 25th August. On arrival, we found the black-top bin already full of rubbish dumped by others, the smell was overwhelming. The landlord kindly arranged for someone to clear the bin, but shortly afterwards we also discovered a box of decayed food and harmful waste left beside it, including rotten food, mouldy flour with maggots, spoiled condiments, cat food and other hazardous waste.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;With no other option, we put on protective clothing, gloves, and masks to handle these items ourselves. We carefully lifted the rotten food and re-bagged it into the black-top bin. These hazardous, decomposed food wastes were impossible for us to sort any further, and dealing with them has already caused us a great deal of shock and stress.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Since then, however, the black bin has repeatedly been rejected for collection due to this old rubbish â€” even though we have strictly followed recycling and waste rules ever since moving in. This problem was not caused by us, yet we have been left to bear the consequences, which has been very stressful. We have already booked a professional bin-cleaning service and are planning to install a camera outside our home to prevent further illegal dumping.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We kindly and urgently ask for your help to clear our black-top bin, as we have truly done everything possible on our side. Thank you very much for your understanding and support.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8142386.0.jpeg?50daf75c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Weigall Road, Kidbrooke, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8142386&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Subject: Urgent Repair Needed â€“ Pothole Outside Willowbank School SE2 9XB.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to report a pothole that has been present for approximately three months in front of Willowbank School, near the pedestrian entrance gate. The pothole has deteriorated further over time and becomes particularly hazardous whenever it rains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given its location, this poses a&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Significant risk to children, parents, and other pedestrians accessing the school on a daily basis. I kindly request that this issue be inspected and repaired as a matter of urgency to ensure the safety of all road users.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Seacourt Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8142338&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Protective railings needs to be extended to protect pedestrians, 9th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8142242</link>
<description>The railings need to be extended to protect more of the pavement area against vehicles buses and trucks that swerve into the pavement due to the turn in the road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is a nursery here and a lot of pedestrian activity. A car swerved into the pavement and hit the wall of 73 Amersham Road. Luckily there no pedestrians passing at that moment or they would have been run over.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There have been a few of these crashes in the last few years and the railing helps but it should be extended to cover the curve in the road and extra 3m or so. This could save someoneâ€™s life!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8142242.0.jpeg?0ff9ec94&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Amersham Road, New Cross, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8142242&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
