<title>Illegal speed bump, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8642982</link>
<description>Why is this illegal speed bump still here? It is unlicensed. It has been badly fixed by residents on a road owned by LBB.It is in extremely poor condition looking as though it might have been recovered from a skip or land fill site. If LBB were to allow such activities to prevail without any intervention, it might appear that LBB condone those activities. As such this might encourage others of a similarly antisocial disposition to also take the law into their own hands. Anarchy in the UK indeed. Surely nobody intelligent , including not only The Sex Pistols themselves, but also their local fan base, the so-called &amp;quot;Bromley Contingent&amp;quot; would want to see that in their own back yard!&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): The Drive, St Paul&#39;s Cray, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8642982&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Issue with flat opposite number 113 frinsted road, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8642897</link>
<description>There is a flag thats on a lamp post right opposite 113 frinsted road. The resident has already reported this and ref number is -: 8637725. He has been told in an email back to his report that they cant find the issue. The point is being missed, he doesn&amp;#39;t have an issue with the flag being there its the way its positioned its been placed higher than the flag before and its causing an issue with the light on the lamp post shining into his property and also with it moving a lot more because of wind and its causing a shadow and this is effecting his CCTV. He has had to put up with this for over 3 months now and keeps reporting it and nothing is happening, please can this be looked into and appropriate action taken&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Frinsted Road, Northumberland Heath, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8642897&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large amount of litter around secluded bench, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8642857</link>
<description>In Croydon Road Recreation Ground, Beckenham there is a bench, somewhat secluded, on the path that leads to the bowling green. Around this bench is a large amount of litter, used beer cans and other things. Looks unsightly and probably a risk to wildlife and the wider environment. Can someone give the area a good clean up please. In the longer term it might be a good idea to remove this bench altogether given its somewhat secluded location and the tendency for it to attract anti-social behaviour.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8642857.0.jpeg?6fd144f0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Shaftesbury Road, Beckenham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8642857&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous sharp wire and trip hazard on wooden walkway, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8642758</link>
<description>This wooden walkway in Scadbury Park has been steadily deteriorating for a while. Now the anti-slip mesh has lifted in several places which has created a significant trip hazard. The sharp wire is also dangerous to wildlife and dogs. It could cause cuts, take an eye out, or puncture their paws. If anything unpleasant were to happen to my own best friend as a result of this hazard, I would be seeking appropriate financial compensation from LBB. Please get it fixed so that two and four legged visitors can enjoy their walk without risking injury. Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8642758.0.jpeg?77ba193f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cardinal Close, Chislehurst, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8642758&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
