<title>Road works! Temporary lights! Road blocks! water stop!, 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8638132</link>
<description>The ongoing roadworks across the borough, which have now been continuing for over a year and are causing unacceptable disruption to daily life. While the situation was already bad, the works that began yesterday have made travel completely unreasonable. A journey that normally takes 10–15 minutes — travelling by bus from Edmonton Green to Enfield College — took 1 hour and 30 minutes yesterday and an extraordinary 3 hours and 45 minutes today. Under normal circumstances, I would have walked most of this journey rather than remain on a bus for hours. However, due to the icy pavement conditions, walking was not a viable option, leaving me with no choice but to stay on the bus throughout the delays. Despite this, the bus was eventually terminated at Tesco, at which point I had no option but to walk the remainder of the journey anyway. The condition and management of these roadworks demonstrate a serious lack of consideration for residents. Traffic congestion is extreme, bus routes are unreliable, and there appears to be little to no effective traffic management in place. People still need to get to work, college, appointments, and home, yet these roadworks are making everyday journeys unnecessarily stressful and time-consuming. Residents are paying the price for what feels like poor planning, poor coordination, and a failure to properly manage the impact of these works. This level of disruption is simply unacceptable. Additionally, as a result of these roadworks, my water supply was cut on the 30th at approximately 12:30am without any prior warning, causing further disruption and highlighting the lack of communication and consideration shown to residents.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): High Street, Ponders End, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8638132&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked drainage pipes, 7th January</title>

<description>All the drainage pipes are blocked in this area causing flooding several inches deep covering the entire area outside the housing whenever it rains. Since the area is where the walkway ends so both cars and people use it too access houses,bus stops etc it can be rather difficult to get around the flooded area&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Crayford Road, Barnes Cray, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8638123&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Request a traffic volume assessment., 7th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8638120</link>
<description>Hi,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There has been a large up tick in learner drivers over the past few months, often you see cars back to back from multiple companies. It appears this residential road is now some kind of DVLA route? Is there any controls that can be put in place, it&amp;#39;s drastically increased traffic, which is pretty unfair for local residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks,&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ronalds Road, Plaistow, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8638120&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>There is a huge pot hole which is impossible to see in the dark. The car physically shook when I hit it - I will need to check for damage in daylight.

<title>Brown settee littered on Harrier Mews Thamesmead pavement., 6th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8637911</link>
<description>As you come into Harrier Mews SE28 0DQ from Goldfinch Road, as you drive into the road, look to your right on the pavement, you will see a pile of dark brown sofa set placed on the pavement. This blights the road and saddens and depresses me a lot to see all these household waste being dumped under the cover of night by local residents. The fact that they do it at night to conceal their identity is clear evidence that these people know it is a crime to fly tip. Please can you investigate the two cases reported tonight and have the nuisance items dumped on our pavements removed. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Merganser Gardens, Thamesmead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8637911&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Household items left on the pedestrian pavement in front of number 35 Harrier Mews Thamesmead London SE28 0DQ, 6th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8637888</link>
<description>The lady living at number 35 Harrier Mews Thamesmead London SE28 0DQ brought the items pictured in the photo attached out of her house on 30/12/2025 and placed them on the public pavement. This not only blights the street, it also prevents wheelchair and pushchairs from free access to the pavement. This lady frequently fly tips items onto the pavement knowing that these household waste will not be collected by the refuse team. This behaviour can’t continue, we are constantly trying to keep up with all these people causing a nuisance by tipping their rubbish everywhere without consideration for the rest of us. It’s just not fair. This lady has an estate car but instead of going to the recycling centre like the rest of us, she chooses to litter the street with her waste. Please kindly address this problem as soon as possible. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8637888.0.jpeg?d225e783&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Harrier Mews, Thamesmead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8637888&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
