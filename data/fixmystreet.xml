<title>Litter strewn all over street by Goodrich school, 11th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8006040</link>
<description>This is a problem that has occurred several times before. Litter has been taken from a bin in a blue plastic bag to be collected no doubt by your staff. Failure to collect it for days has meant foxes,rats etc have split it to get to discarded food. There is a similar problem on Underhill Road by Lew Evans Care Home. Leaving thin plastic bags containg discarded foods nappies etc to await collection is really a bad idea and the council needs to think of an alternativr&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Upland Road, East Dulwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8006040&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous asbestos on allotment reported and closed with no action being taken, 11th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8006020</link>
<description>A large amount of asbestos has ben found on Grasmere Allotment Plot 15B after inspection. This is a potentially dangerous health and safety issue as the tenants of adjoining plots often have very young children with them. The Plot has been unattended for several years and it is believed that the asbestos originated from the previous owner, deceased for several years, of the property at Grasmere Road adjoining the plot who also was tenant of Plots 15A and 15B on the allotment for 40 or more years. This has been reported to the Council and to the Allotment Help Desk and Grounds Maintenance several times with no action being taken, no response other than acknowledgement from the Help Desk and NO HELP. THIS HAS BEEN REPORTED SEVERAL TIMES AND DESPITE BEING TOLD IT IS BEING DEALT WITH OR BEING ACTIONED NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE. THE MATTER KEEPS BEING CLOSED WITH NOTHING BEING DONE. THIS IS PREVENTING THE PLOT BEING TENANTED AND IS A LOSS OF REVENUE TO THE COUNCIL&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 61, Grasmere Road, Barnehurst, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8006020&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Please can we have more litter bins and bigger litter bins like the one in the photograph. We have had a significant amount of increased footfall in Bromley Palace Park, more dog walkers and a lot more people having picnics. The bins are emptied regularly. Which is great, but unfortunately the bins are regularly overflowing now, so we could do with a couple more and big, fox proof ones please as we have seven mischievous foxes in the park.
