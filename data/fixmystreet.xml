<title>Another large pothole, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8852365</link>
<description>Large (30 cm wide) pothole which is damaging cars. Please fix&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To be honest, from the bottom of Parkside Gardens to Capel Road there are multiple dangerously large holes. Just as you did when the speed bumps were installed, the entire road should be closed for proper resurfacing. It will be cheaper and safer in the long run.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 128, Church Hill Road, East Barnet, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8852365&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Two 30cm potholes by the speed bump, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8852306</link>
<description>By the speedbump past Avondale Road and towards East Barnet village, there are two wide and deep potholes. Cars try to avoid them but a serious collision is waiting to happen any day, when someone misjudges the speed of a vehicle in the opposite direction. The holes are getting larger with the persistent rain and those that do drive over them are damaging their vehicles.

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8851999</link>
<description>Hi, I am reporting an incident of fly-tipping located near my apartment in Greenwich. Several bulky items, including a mattress and pieces of furniture, have been illegally dumped on the [pavement/roadside]. ​Please note that these items do not belong to me; they were left here by an unknown person. As this is obstructing the area and constitutes illegal dumping, I am requesting the Council to investigate and clear the site.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Pelton Road, Greenwich&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8851999&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
