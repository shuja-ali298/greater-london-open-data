<title>Cars speeding at 35 - 40 mph on Sandford &amp; Ethronvi Rd, 14th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8546722</link>
<description>I am resident living on Ethronvi Rd for the past 10 years and my house is close to the intersect between Sandford Road &amp;amp; Ethronvi Road. In both directions cars are constantly speeding hitting speeds of 35 - 40+ mph. I have witnessed over 15 car accidents in my time living here. But my biggest concern is the fact there is a nursery at the end of Sandford Road and a soft play at the end of Ethronvi Road/ near Queen street. Vulnerable people live here and there are lots of families and elderly people in this community. I don&amp;#39;t want there to be a major death or fatality before changes come about to ensure that these issues do not happen again. There needs to be speed bumps along both roads &amp;amp; or lots of speed cameras to change the delinquent behaviour of cars speeding. Deadly driving is a liability to our community and society at large and with speed cameras on these two roads along with speed bumps it can provide Bexley council with additional revenue streams and also drive down the rate of antisocial behaviour as well as fatalities.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harcourt Road, Blendon, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8546722&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Urgent Road Safety Measures Required at Sandford Road &amp; Ethronvi Road, 14th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8546708</link>
<description>I am a local resident and have lived in this area for over three years. My home is located close to the junction of Sandford Road and Ethronvi Road, and I am writing as a concerned parent and member of the community to formally raise serious and ongoing road safety concerns.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Excessive speeding on both Sandford Road and Ethronvi Road is constant and highly visible. Vehicles regularly travel at speeds far above what is safe for a residential area, often reaching an estimated 35 to over 40 miles per hour. During my time living here, I have personally witnessed more than seven road traffic collisions at or near this junction. These incidents are not isolated and reflect a persistent pattern of dangerous driving behaviour.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This location presents a particularly high risk due to the presence of vulnerable road users. A nursery is located at the end of Sandford Road, and a children’s soft play centre operates near the end of Ethronvi Road close to Queen Street. The surrounding streets are home to many young families, elderly residents and pedestrians who rely on these roads daily.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Local and borough level data reinforces these concerns. Publicly available Transport for London and Metropolitan Police collision data shows that Bexley records hundreds of reported road traffic collisions each year, with a significant proportion occurring on residential roads. Speed is consistently cited as one of the most common contributing factors in serious and fatal collisions across the borough. Nationally, government data shows that pedestrians struck at 40 miles per hour are around five times more likely to be killed than those struck at 30 miles per hour. These risks are well understood and widely documented.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Traffic calming measures are proven to work. Department for Transport evidence shows that speed humps and raised tables can reduce average vehicle speeds by up to 25 percent and reduce injury collisions by more than half on residential roads. Speed enforcement cameras have also been shown to significantly reduce repeat speeding offences and serious collisions in high risk locations.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am extremely concerned that without intervention it will only be a matter of time before a serious injury or fatality occurs, potentially involving a child. It should not require a tragic incident to prompt preventative action when the danger is already evident and ongoing.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I strongly urge Bexley Council to take immediate action by implementing the following measures:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Installation of speed humps or raised traffic calming features along both Sandford Road and Ethronvi Road Installation of permanent speed enforcement cameras to deter persistent speeding A formal road safety assessment and speed monitoring review of this junction and surrounding streets&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition to improving safety, these measures would reduce antisocial driving behaviour, lower the long term burden on emergency services and the NHS, and provide enforcement revenue that can be reinvested into local transport and safety initiatives.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not simply a traffic management issue. It is a public safety matter affecting children, families and older residents who should be able to move around their community without fear. I respectfully ask the Council to treat this issue with urgency and to confirm what actions will be taken and within what timeframe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to your response and to seeing meaningful steps taken to protect this community.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yours sincerely,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A concerned resident and parent&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ethronvi Road, Blendon, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8546708&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
