<title>Big pothole a40 heading westbound, 9th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8393519</link>
<description>Hello,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I was driving yesterday on the A40 Westbound near the 30mph average speed, and all of a sudden my left front tyre went into a massive pot hole, cause a lot of damage to my tyre and alignment.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I don’t know how this has happened, and needs fixing quickly. I was very very scared as it was a loud noise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I couldn’t take a photo as it’s a dual carriage way and was dark at night. That section of the road has no lights either.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Westway, North Kensington, City of Westminster&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8393519&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Graffiti on wall in Glenn’s Path, 9th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8393518</link>
<description>Graffiti has appeared on the wall of the new ‘Greenwich Builds’ housing development Bowness Close which backs directly onto Glenlea Path. This is despite assurances by the ‘Greenwich Builds’ team when the development was being constructed in 2021 that the garden &amp;amp; rear walls of the development would be subject to anti-graffiti treatment to prevent this problem from occurring. Graffiti has appeared within last few days.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8393518.0.jpeg?b9902cc1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Rochester Way Relief Road, Well Hall, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8393518&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Firewood/smell of skunk/wheelbarrow/rotting leaves, 9th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8393510</link>
<description>Since Monday 3rd November a huge bag of firewood on a wooden palette has been dumped o/s 57 Kinsale Road. It is a fire hazard (especially with fireworks being set off by all manner of barnyard reared yoot)and also blocking the pavement meaning wheelchair users, ambulant disabled people, those using pushchairs, elderly people, foxes and the shitsus who look like mop heads and live on the road are not able to pass safely. There is also a continual smell of skunk emanating from the address. It has left animals/pets stoned and getting the munchies. Out of nowhere a wheelbarrow has appeared, dumped in the road. Whether the wheelbarrow is linked to the firewood is unclear. In addition Kinsale Road is covered in rotting fallen leaves and the Council never send anyone to sweep this all up. Those leaves when wet have caused numerous falls and are a danger to elderly people. In summary, why is this road and area becoming a wild state where people seemingly wish to dump all their crap all over the place?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8393510.0.jpeg?6eddc109&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 51, Kinsale Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8393510&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
