<title>Rubbish has been dumped in multiple spots across the street, outside different homes. It appears to have been left during the night by unknown individuals. Some of the items are sharp and could cause injury. Residents have confirmed the rubbish does not belong to them. Please arrange for urgent removal., 21st July</title>

<description>There has been continuous fly-tipping in this street, and the issue is getting worse. Rubbish has been dumped in several spots outside different houses — here and there — across the road. It looks scattered and abandoned.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A few nights ago, I saw three people wearing face masks moving through the street during the late hours. They appeared to be dumping rubbish outside multiple homes and quickly walked away.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Currently, various items are lying around the bins and pavements. Some objects are sharp or bulky, which could cause someone to trip or get hurt, especially at night.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Local residents I’ve spoken to confirmed this rubbish doesn’t belong to them. It is creating an unpleasant and unsafe environment. I am a concerned local resident reporting this anonymously and kindly request that the area be cleaned up as soon as possible.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2,4,6,8, Dylways, Dulwich Village, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7908224&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fly tipping and inappropriate behaviour by roadsweeper, 21st July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7908216</link>
<description>This morning (21/7/25) I placed some fly-tipped rubbish in the big blue bin on the corner of Revelon Road. I did this to prevent other people discarding rubbish in the same area, which can become a public health hazard. The road sweeper, on the opposite side of the road, accused me of discarding my own rubbish in the big blue bin, which was not true at all. Not only that, in stating that I could be fined (for something I didn’t do - in fact, I was giving a service to the community) he used the f-word in front of my 7 year old son. I find this unacceptable behaviour by a council employee. Indeed, given the amount of council tax that the council collects, I shouldn’t have to be the one who is clearing up other people’s rubbish to begin with.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Revelon Road, Brockley, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7908216&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Outside 96, 98, 100 Wickham Road, 21st July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7908176</link>
<description>The pavement out Park Langley parade of shops is constantly being parked on causing problems for people using the public pavement. The cars are parking with 2 wheels on the pavement. This pavement is already narrow and with a lot of parent&amp;#39;s, dog walkers and elderly people using the local shops it has become a hazard. The wing mirrors on the cars are dangerous as witnessed today when a little boy smashed his face on the second car shown in the photos. You can also see that the pavement is being damaged by cars parking on them. Could please address this.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7908176.0.jpeg?8db2b93c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 98, Wickham Road, Beckenham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7908176&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
