<title>Safety barriers are required on this stretch of road/pavement, 18th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7730796</link>
<description>Safety barriers are required on this stretch of road/pavement, which is now a very busy area for business usage and attracts a large number of people sitting outside - including children and families - especially during the warmer months. The parade of shops between Mackenzie Rd and Birkbeck Rd houses a pub, coffee shop and restaurant - all of which have thriving, well used outdoors spaces. However people are forced to sit next to a road which attracts constant, busy traffic. As Bromley refuses to implement 20mph on its roads, this means people have to sit just centimetres away from very fast-moving traffic with no barrier or defence. Tonight there was a very serious crash (photos attached) where the car hit a traffic island (which feels poorly placed) and almost entered the seating area of El Molino restaurant, where young families were sitting enjoying a meal. This was a narrowly avoided tragedy. In the mornings, that seating area is often very busy with mums and kids enjoying a coffee/snack at the Loki Cafe. Some form of robust barrier/metal fencing is required to separate the road and the pavement, and to ensure that cars are not able to leave the road and kill several people, should the worst happen. This would be relatively inexpensive and would save lives. Please can this be implemented asap.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7730796.0.jpeg?f1d6806f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 253, Beckenham Road, Penge, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7730796&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Safety fence damaged and needs replacing, 18th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7730783</link>
<description>Dear all, The safety fencing that helps prevent people from falling into the lake was damaged by eight teenagers who visited the park today. They have tried damaging more of it and have loosened the entire length of the fencing which is now not doing what bit was installed for. To be fair, the upright wooden posts are rotting the bottom, so it didn’t take much of a push and pull for them to be damaged. Thankfully we managed to chase them off before more damage could be done to this fencing. We have put it back together as best as possible, but it’s extremely weak for the whole length of the pathway at the side of the moat. Please can you attend as soon as possible. Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7730783.0.jpeg?b2d0b3e4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Rochester Avenue, Widmore, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7730783&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bollards acting as a road hazard, 18th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7730747</link>
<description>No less than four vehicles crashed into these bollards today. One at night, which is typical as its not easily visible nor reflective, and three this afternoon. the crashes at night always wake me and my housemates up as It makes a very loud bang when cars either drive clean over them and then come to a stop or crash into it and stop right on top of them. One of the cars today was visible damaged. The cars that crash into it are always turning right (north) onto Lisson Grove after exiting Lodge Road. Surely this is due to poor placement of the bollards which seem to serve no purpose. Additionally, is it not a liability for the council?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7730747.0.jpeg?0185cfad&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lisson Grove, St. John&#39;s Wood, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7730747&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
