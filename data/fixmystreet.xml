<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372798</link>
<description>Since the road was resurfaced in the last year or so, the drain level is now a fair amount below the surface of the road. This is causing a loud noise and vibrations in the house every time a bus, lorry, fire engine etc goes over it after leaving the roundabout. This is happening several times an hour. Please review and rectify this.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Long Lane, West Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372798&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Osborne Road needs more electric charging point on lamp post to help residents who have disabled electric vehicles to be able to charge car.Electric Charging Station. There is only one electronic charging station on Osborne Road and there is multiple vehicles who use it. Hackney Council need to invest more money in electric charging point bays Osborne Road. I am a resident on Semley gate Road and have an electric vehicle. I have also got a permit for Z55 area where I park the car. The closest (only) charging station available is on this semley gate but only permit holders K can use it. I need somewhere to charge my car. If the council do not install more electronic charging ports on Osborne Road it will cause a divide and frustration amongst motorist. There has been an incident in Hackney where one motorist left his car on charged for a whole day. The motorist of this zip higher car was being selfish hogging the charging station point up in Hackney another motorist took the law into his own hands and served justice on this selfish charging hog. Another motorist was unable to use the charging point because of this selfish driver occupying charging points so the other motorists smashed and vandalised the vehicle. The motorist smashed all the windows on the higher car and even smash the side mirrors. This is why hackney council have to put more charging points in because it is causing road rage, vandalism because not everyone can use the charging points. Please Hackney Council do something about this. You have time to invest in line bikes and allocate bay for antisocial behavior line bikes. why not allocate more charging bay, points for residents cars., 3rd November</title>

<description>Please help hackney council invest more in charging points for residents on Osborne road.Relax the road rage and vandalism being caused by frustrated motorists.
