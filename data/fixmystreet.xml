<title>Ongoing problem with dog fouling, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8680544</link>
<description>I am writing to make a formal and urgent complaint about a serious and ongoing problem with dog fouling on Morden Street, located near Morden Mount Primary School.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The amount of dog poo left along the pavement is excessive and completely unacceptable. There is a clear lack of control in this area. To give a specific example, I personally counted six separate dog poos on the same side of Morden Street within less than 60 metres. This shows how severe and persistent the problem is. Council officers can easily attend and check this themselves.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have attached photographs as evidence. This is not an isolated incident, it happens constantly and is getting worse.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This street is used daily by families and children walking to and from school. I also have a toddler, and it has become extremely difficult and unsafe to walk outside without the risk of stepping in dog waste. This poses a serious health risk, particularly to young children.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Despite the seriousness of the situation, there appears to be no effective enforcement or monitoring in this area. I am requesting urgent action, including:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Increased street cleaning on Morden Street&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Clear warning signage&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Enforcement patrols and fines for irresponsible dog owners&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The current situation is unacceptable and shows a serious lack of control. I would appreciate confirmation that this complaint has been logged and clear information on what action will be taken.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Morden Street, Lewisham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8680544&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Opposite the marriott hotel on adelaide road, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8680499</link>
<description>A number of my neighbours have already reported the vibrations caused by the manhole and pothole on Adelaide Road, causing the row of houses on Hornby Close to vibrate violently. This is causing severe sleep deprivation and we believe the shaking has led to the damage of a radiator cover in one of our bedrooms. We will appreciate the matter being looked into urgently.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Alexandra Road, South Hampstead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8680499&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>All lights out on the A bridge, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8680496</link>
<description>Was told to re - report if the issue hadn&amp;#39;t been fixed after 4 weeks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Its been 4 weeks and its not been fixed. All lights are out both sides of the pedestrian crossing section of the A bridge. This is the only pedestrian route to north Thamesmead and it feels very very unsafe. This really needs to be sorted before someone either has an accident as its that Dark especially on the north side or even worse is attacked.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8680496&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
