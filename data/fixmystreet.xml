<title>Potholes in Maple Crescent, 27th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9013223</link>
<description>You will see when you inspect the road surface in Maple Crescent that over the years temporary repairs have been made to the road surface In fact it lookslike a patchwork quilt. The potholes are getting worse (see accompanying photos) This is being made worse due to vehicles not wanting to wait in traffic at the ATS Wellington Ave j/w Blackfen Road and turning into Maple Crescent increasing traffic flow in the road. The whole road including the Cul de Sac in Maple Crescent needs totally resurfacing as the last time this was done was 30 years ago when a Thames Water main burst causing surgery flooding. The road markings have also faded or are no existent.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/9013223.0.jpeg?f58501b4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 19, Maple Crescent, Blackfen, Sidcup, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9013223&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flytipping around the back of Royal Hill Court, 27th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9013202</link>
<description>Dear Environmental Services Team,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to report a large-scale fly-tipping incident in the service alley behind Royal Hill Court. The dumped waste is approximately a van-load (around one third of a skip) and appears to be construction/commercial debris of unknown origin.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This alley is a mixed-use access route used by: - Residents of Royal Hill Court - Multiple commercial back entrances - Council bin collection services&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Although the land appears to be owned by TfL (adjacent to a fenced TfL area), the location functions as a shared service alley affecting residential access and sanitation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not a minor dumping incident. The volume is significant, unsanitary, and has previously required private removal costing residents approximately £700, which is not sustainable and should not fall on residents where fly-tipping is involved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I also have asthma and am concerned about dust exposure from unknown construction materials being left in a confined residential access area. There may be toxic fibres in the debris I am unsure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given: - The scale of the waste (van-load size) - The shared residential and waste collection use of the alley - The unsanitary conditions - The repeat nature of fly-tipping in this exact location&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am requesting: 1) Inspection and clearance of the fly-tipped waste as a priority sanitation issue 2) Investigation into potential commercial dumping, particularly in relation to nearby skip activity 3) Confirmation of responsibility coordination between the council and TfL as landowner&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I can provide photographs and additional context if required, and nearby commercial CCTV (Sainsbury’s) may also be available showing vehicle activity.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This situation is causing ongoing environmental distress and avoidance of the rear access area by residents, and I would greatly appreciate prompt action.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards, James Beckwith Royal Hill Court Resident&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/9013202.0.jpeg?1fbab67f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Greenwich High Road, Greenwich&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/9013202&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
