<title>Lights out. Re occuring problem., 20th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8966299</link>
<description>The service rd lights between Rail Sidings Rd and Dockley Rd along with the walk through and stairwell to Lucey are not working AGAIN. This is a frequently re occuring problem that needs to be resolved once and for all. Although there is some lighting from the trading estate that partially illuminates the service rd, the walk through and stairwell between 72 and 74 Lucey way is dark and dangerous for vulnerable people. It also encourages the dumping of rubbish at the foot of the stairs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8966299.0.jpeg?0d11bfe8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lucey Way, Bermondsey, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8966299&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Open big black bin with food in, 20th February</title>

<description>My neighbour has left a giant black sack full of rubbish and food outside the front of our house. It is too large for me to lift and it won’t fit in the wheelie bin. Refuse collection is not for another week. It is starting to smell and I am worried it’s going to attract rodents. We have children here please can waste services come to collect. I have tried asking the neighbour to sort but they are not being helpful or reasonable.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Thayers Farm Road, New Beckenham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8966212&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>There is a severely damaged and open utility cabinet located on the pavement directly opposite Mornington Crescent Station (near the junction with Crowndale Road). The door is hanging wide open, exposing a mass of internal wiring to the elements. There is some yellow tape on the unit, but it is no longer securing the door. This poses a trip hazard and a potential electrical risk to pedestrians, particularly given the wet weather. Please secure the unit as soon as possible&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Camden High Street, Fitzrovia, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8966130&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
