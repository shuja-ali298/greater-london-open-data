<description>Please reinstate the height warning sign on the metal railway bridge, south side near 90a, Upper Elmers End Rd, Beckenham which was dislodged in a lorry strike about 9 months, ago.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The substitute footway, pole-mounted sign is far less prominent and, I would say, inadequate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bridge strikes cause huge disruption to road and rail traffic, and potential injury / death to drivers and passengers.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8478571.0.jpeg?d61e5f56&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Upper Elmers End Road, Upper Elmers End, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8478571&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The road surface is quite damaged with significant dips and potholes which leads to severe vibrations in my property whenever one of the C11 bus pass by. The problem is further aggravated when the bus is electric due to the increased weight of the machine. Considering the issue has been ongoing for months now, can you please urgently action a resurfacing of the road to prevent such holes and subsequent vibrations? thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 95, Canfield Gardens, South Hampstead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8478558&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked manhole, 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8478534</link>
<description>Dear Bexley Council,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The issue is now affecting a number of properties.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to seek clarification regarding the ongoing drainage issues on Pickford Close. As previously confirmed by the Council, the drainage system in this area was constructed in the 1930s, and Council teams have attended on multiple occasions in the past to unblock the drainage system via the manhole on 15 Pickford Close.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given this history, I am confused by the recent statement that you are unable to assist. Residents of Pickford Close, including myself, are fully aware that the Council has regularly attended to this issue and carried out the necessary maintenance when blockages occur.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Could you please clarify why assistance is now being declined, despite the long-standing responsibility and previous actions taken by the Council?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate an explanation and confirmation of the next steps, as this issue continues to affect the residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to your prompt response.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks &amp;amp; Regards&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pickford Close, Welling, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8478534&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ref: 8354962 unsolved issue. Trip hazards., 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8478398</link>
<description>Only part of the pavement has been fixed from my &amp;quot;solved issue&amp;quot;, and the bit that has been fixed is absolutely shocking. No care taken in the look of it at all. Clearly this isn&amp;#39;t being signed off by any supervisor as it looks like a blind person has screeded this concrete. As I said in my first complaint, the WHOLE pavement needs re doing in the whole of Dane Close. My mum recently tripped and pulled her muscle in her leg and she&amp;#39;s nearly 70. Myself, or others will sue if any further injuries do occure as this has been complained about. As I have said before the road is full of elderly people, one in particular who is scared to use his mobility scooter because of the risk of falling out of it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This needs sorting.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;James Ball&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 9, Dane Close, Bexley, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8478398&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
