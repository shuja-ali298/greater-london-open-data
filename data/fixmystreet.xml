<title>Globe Stairs, SE16 5XS, 20th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7903757</link>
<description>I am writing to formally raise an urgent complaint regarding 3 vehicles that are consistently illegally parked on the pavement on the Thames Path of East Globe Wharf, located at 205 Rotherhithe Street, London SE16 5XS. This issue has persisted for approximately three months, with the vehicles in question appearing every evening and overnight.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The plate numbers for the vehicles are: SF05 XNX LL62 KKA LG10 FFU&amp;#10;&amp;#10;These vehicles are blocking a designated fire exit, creating a serious and ongoing public safety hazard for all residents of the building. In the event of an emergency, the obstruction could significantly delay or prevent safe evacuation, which is of grave concern to all occupants.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The individuals responsible have also been extremely loud and disruptive during the late evening hours. When I approached them respectfully to explain the danger and legal issues involved, they responded with mocking behaviour, laughed at me, and continued parking in the same location, clearly demonstrating disregard for the law and public safety.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7903757.0.jpeg?f389007a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 205, Rotherhithe Street, Rotherhithe, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7903757&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Mostly builders waste dumped corner of shore road/well st, 19th July</title>

<description>I witnessed this waste being dumped by two males coming out of Star Value Supermarket. The rubbish was being carried through the shop out to the front (Well St), so I assume they work there. This was Tuesday 15th July at around 6:30pm.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Well Street, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7903755&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Elevated manhole that seems to have been recently constructed. It has been built too close to the road and poses an obstruction to moving and parked vehicles., 19th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7903746</link>
<description>I’m unsure on how long the manhole has been there for as I am not a permanent resident in the area. However, I come regularly and have only recently noticed it there. The parking area is quite narrow and restricted and it can be difficult to manoeuvre. This new manhole that has been constructed, is too close to the road and is an obstruction to vehicles trying to park. Additionally, it poses a health and safety risk to the public due to the manhole cover not being secured to the manhole structure. This was evident when I drove my car, and the manhole cover was easily moved and result in damages to my front passenger bumper and wheel, as well as leaving the manhole completely open to the public.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7903746.0.jpeg?be80da95&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Sycamore Court, Northumberland Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7903746&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Obstruction of traffic via Lower Road slip onto the dual carriageway, there is a huge bush that prevents drivers from seeing oncoming cars, 19th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7903725</link>
<description>As you enter the slip road onto the dual carriageway, there is a huge bush that prevents drivers from seeing oncoming cars on the left lane, and as the slip road is very short, it can cause serious injuries if the driver merges into the left lane and they are not able to see a car. Please can you ensure the hedge is trimmed very short to ensure a driver is able to see oncoming traffic as they enter the slip road from Lower Road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bronze Age Way, Northumberland Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7903725&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
