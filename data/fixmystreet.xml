<title>Loose manhole cover, loud bang sound when car passes by, 27th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8782454</link>
<description>Every time a vehicle drives over it, especially busses, it makes a very loud banging noise, especially at night. The noise is constant and is disturbing sleep for nearby residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The cover appears to move when vehicles pass over it and may also present a potential safety risk.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is over a month now! It’s driving the local residents crazy!!! Don’t make this fixed unless you actually do something about this!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8782454.0.jpeg?8bcaa096&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Weigall Road, Kidbrooke&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8782454&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pavement narrow and dangerous for pedestrians, 27th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8782424</link>
<description>This report relates to an ongoing public safety risk, not a planning matter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A fixed structure has been installed on the public highway, reducing the effective clear footway width to below accepted minimum standards. The location is adjacent to a busy carriageway and at a bus stop, where pedestrian footfall and dwell time are higher.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This creates a foreseeable risk to pedestrians, including wheelchair users, pushchairs, and those with visual or mobility impairments, who may be forced into the carriageway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please confirm whether a highways or public safety assessment has been carried out, and if so confirm: - the date of the assessment - the department responsible - whether the structure has been assessed as safe or unsafe in its current form&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If no such assessment has been undertaken, please confirm when it will be carried out.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This report cannot be closed until the council has formally recorded a safety assessment outcome, as the risk is ongoing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 10, Plaistow Lane, Plaistow, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8782424&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
