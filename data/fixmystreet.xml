<title>Kentish Town rd, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8677914</link>
<description>Over the past 20+ years Kentish Town road is always jammed and I wonder why it has not yet been sorted out. I take bus 134 and once we get to Kentish Town Rd it gets stuck for more than half hour, sometimes one hour!! This is utterly ridiculous and I want to know what are you doing about it as it’s been like this for over 20years!! I have to take the bus as I can’t afford the tube and I expect to get to work on time but this is becoming difficult and you got to sort out that road ASAP!!! It’s ridiculous and I wonder why there are always road work going on, again for the past 20years! What’s going on? Let me know thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 23, Kentish Town Road, Kentish Town, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8677914&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Old food waste all over pavement- slippery and smelly, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8677898</link>
<description>The pavement which belongs to the council is disgraceful. There seems to have been food spilled over the pavement I guess from the bin. This has been like this for 2 weeks. There is also leaves and mud on the pavement and road. Making it slippery and dangerous for children.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is also wooden signs someone has put there saying temple car park but these are trip hazards at road crossing junction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This area really needs a good clean to make a nicer and safer environment for the school children who are as young as 3. This is not the schools responsibility as it is outside of the school on the council pavement and road. Further round needs a good tidy up too along the Lower road. You have 2 schools opposite for disabled children yet have let the are go to pot. We are working people and children attending school paying our taxes. We desserve a healthier environment. Please can this be looked into as an urgent matter.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It’s so sad when I am teaching my child about litter and how to behave when this is the example she sees.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Mitchell Close, Lower Belvedere, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8677898&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
