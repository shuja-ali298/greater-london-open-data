<title>On 05/10/24 at 17:50pm there was a big white Peugeot van plate number NU68 JYE in the driveway blocking the access and a Turkish/Kurdish looking guy having an issue with the barrier gate. Turkish/Kurdish said my key is stuck in the lock and I cannot get it out.explained to the Turkish guy that he had put the obsolete incorrect key H55T1 in the lock and caused it to get jammed which I explained to the guy you have got the wrong key. this is what the problem is. Turkish guy to make a complaint and report the issue to Randall kerry garage team and Simon Priscilla the local housing manager and make him aware of the issue with the gate and how fed up you are of not being able to get your van/car through the barrier gate to access your garage at 14,11 for about two/three months Turkish guy said they are taking the f****** piss. I pay my rent.Turkish guy said he leases two garage one is his son at 14 and the other one at 11 is the Turkish guys garage because he has not been given a new H55 correct Key. The Turkish guy has the old obsolete key which is H55T1 which has caused this problem and caused the leaseholder non-intentionally to break the barrier gate lock by putting the wrong key in the lock and turning it and it jammed. The Turkish guy then went to his white van and got a pair of monkey grip pliers out and then tried clamping the key with the pliers and twisting it which probably made the problem worse. The Turkish guy said someone from the hackney council told his son they are going to push a new key under his garage door at number 14 in an envelope. The Turkish guy said you are my witness you see what happened. Then the Turkish guy opened the garage at number 14 and there was a key inside an envelope which a Hackney council member has put there but it is too late now the damage has been caused because Hackney council hasn&#39;t issued leaseholder new barrier gate keys which is incompetent on their behalf. Barrier gate at Osborne Road still broken has not been repaired what is Hackney Council authority doing about this just trying to forget about it get the job fixed people pay their rent. How long must this go on., 16th June</title>

<description>Some lazy hiree of a lime scooter has left the scooter outside the gates of the Peabody estate. I can only assume they live there and couldn’t be bothered leaving it in a proper parking bay which is literally meters away. This makes it very difficult for residence with push chairs, mobility scooters et cetera to exit the Peabody estate which has hundreds of flats selfish selfish people and a selfish selfish company. To enable and actively encourage such antisocial behaviour.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7719954.0.jpeg?fe29f7db&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Duchy Street, Waterloo, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7719954&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
