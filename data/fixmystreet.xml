<title>Fly tipping, 16th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427352</link>
<description>There seems to be a certain person/s Flytipping around this estate . Today i came across 2 builder sacks full of waste that has been fly tipped. Im sure this is the same person/s who has been fly tipping in the area for the last 2 months . It wouldn&amp;#39;t take much for greenwich council to catch this person in the act. Its making the estate look like a dumping ground.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Flintmill Crescent, Kidbrooke&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427352&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bricks in a foundation wall between Ellenbourgh Rd and northCray road have not been replaced properly after separation railing was damaged and replaced Some bricks now missing and others are falling on to pavement causing difficulties to pavement users some Bricks at hidden from view under piles of weeds and leaves, 16th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427333</link>
<description>This problem has existed for some time, since the railing was damaged by a vehicle crashing into it, which had a temporary plastic cover to cover the damage. But when the railing section eventually arrived, the fitting team only connected it with four bolts to the other sections, but did not repair the railing legs back into the damaged red brick wall below. Maybe a second look may make the barrier railing 99 percent safe and not a source of danger to prams and mobility scooters and pedestrians alike&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): North Cray Road, North Cray, London Borough of Bexley&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427333&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Parkland being destroyed by vehicles driving on the grass, 16th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427279</link>
<description>Previous Report reference: 8335658 (In progress) - Service Vehicles driving on park grass. This report was made on October 27th. The first image taken at that time. Three weeks later and as the new images show the grass has been totally destroyed and every day the mud from this damage is all over the public footpath. This is not only in this place in the park where this is happening its in other places anyone can see all over the park. If the issue is the vehicle is to big for the path the something needs to be done. Someone is going to have an accident slipping on the mud all over the footpath in all these areas. On top of that winter hasn&amp;#39;t even begun and already we have lost the grass that recovered in the summer. May be a fence needs to be placed here to stop the contractors driving on the grass ? Please can you help. We understand they need to do their job in a timely manor however not at the detriment of the safety of the public and the preservation of our park land.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8427279.0.jpeg?a32b17d4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Court Road, Poverest, Orpington, London Borough of Bromley&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427279&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
