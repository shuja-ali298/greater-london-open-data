<description>A van dumped this lot in the early hours of the morning. Total impunity! Please install a camera and catch these people.

<description>There is a fridge left outside the old Barclays Bank. It is at the top of the ramp. I flagged this yesterday and the report was ‘fixed’ but it is definitely still there. I witnessed &amp;amp; have on video (and can ID) the people who did this- so council please contact me (as it was a business that did this).&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7952722.0.jpeg?97b572b8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tower Bridge Road, Old Kent Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7952722&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pothole, 30th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7952682</link>
<description>A pothole that was repaired as a GOOD WILL GESTURE is again causing excessive noise at 2am onwards. The zebra crossing located in Bourne Road adjacent Hall Place Crescent is causing endless sleepless nights and early morning wake ups as early as 3:00am everyday because the pothole and the crossing being RAISED. Every night, every morning, skip lorries, lorries and motorbikes bounce over a defect in the road prior to the crossing then they go over the THE RAISED aspect causes loud bangs, motor bikes slow down then rev up and accelerate away.... after the exit the crossing a pothole has again appeared, this is causing me and my mainly elderly neighbours along Bourne Mead endless sleepless night and early morning wake ups with the windows open or closed. Honestly sitting here typing now its consistent BANG after BANG ...... !! Can someone please contact me or arrange a meeting for me to discuss the raised crossing, if it was flat it or potholes repaired it would prevent the majority of noise.... I have lived here for 23 years and this is inconsiderate and unnecessary noise. The crossing is rarely used, I did mention this when it was first planned but nobody listened or replied, its not only dangerously located and especially for those with prams and pushchairs to cross the road onto a very narrow footpath that forces them into the road to navigate around the lamposts. Know one wants to come and visit or speak to me. I am happy to discuss this and show whom ever is responsible to make the changes to the crossing, To come and see for themselves so I can show them and they can hear the noise, I dont expect anyone to come down and have a cuppa tea and show them that persons wanting to cross the road still walk up to where the gate is next to the Mazda garage. I have videos of the defects and recordings of the noise in the early hours. If you provide me an email or make an appointment for me to speak to someone who is going to do something and listen to my views and not fob me off which I feel I have been once again. I will forward them. Once again NOBODY IS LISTENING OR CAN BE BOTHERED TO SPEAK TO ME DIRECTLY 07885638800 please feel free to call.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7952682.0.jpeg?db00dd82&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bourne Mead, Crayford, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7952682&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree Needs Pruning, 30th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7952591</link>
<description>Despite my previous report being marked as fixed, this issue has not been fixed at all. The tree surgeons were in my street last week but did not touch this tree at all. Please can you fix it. The tree now overhangs my drive so my bins, wall, driveway and car are now covered in bird droppings. It is constantly shedding large twigs that land on my car and drive. It is also growing around the fibre broadband cables to mine and neighbouring properties. I would appreciate it if you could action the pruning asap please. To be clear, I don’t want the tree completely felled, as the trees in the street look good, just a significant pruning please.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7952591.0.jpeg?b9111e53&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 44, Chaucer Road, Albany Park, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7952591&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
