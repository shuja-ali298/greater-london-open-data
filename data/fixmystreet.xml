<title>Severe traffic congestion on event or match days due to uncontrolled parking on Pretoria Road, 6th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8636821</link>
<description>Football match days at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, Pretoria Road (opposite White Hart Lane Station) regularly becomes severely congested due to vehicles being allowed to park on both sides of the road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The road is too narrow to safely accommodate two-way traffic when parking is permitted on both sides. As a result, traffic frequently gridlocks, causing significant delays for residents, with journeys of only a few minutes taking up to an hour or more.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not primarily a parking enforcement issue, but a traffic management failure on event days. While resident parking on the housing side is understandable, allowing parking on the opposite side removes any effective traffic flow.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Temporary controls and enforcement were previously in place but appear to have been withdrawn, and the situation has since deteriorated again.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This ongoing congestion disrupts residents’ access to their homes and raises serious concerns regarding emergency vehicle access during peak match-day periods. There have been occasions where ambulances responding to the nearby North Middlesex University Hospital have been caught in this congestion, raising concerns about delayed emergency access.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A review of event-day traffic controls, parking restrictions, and enforcement on Pretoria Road is urgently required.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pretoria Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8636821&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large branch overhanging footpath, 6th January</title>

<description>The tree is located in Nunhead Cemetery and overhangs the Brockley Footpath (highways land) and the neighbouring property (33 Borland Road) where the photo is taken. It&amp;#39;s been a longstanding issue but we&amp;#39;re about the rebuild the retaining wall along the footpath and keen to resolve this historic issue as it blocks a big chunk of the communal garden when in leaf.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8636808.0.jpeg?17ed10dd&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brockley Footpath, Nunhead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8636808&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ongoing road surface contamination and deterioration on Commercial Road due to commercial activity., 6th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8636778</link>
<description>Ongoing commercial activity is causing dust, dirt, and debris to be repeatedly tracked onto the road surface on Commercial Road, leading to visible contamination and deterioration of the carriageway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Vehicles entering and leaving the site are spreading material across the road, resulting in a dirty and uneven surface that presents a road safety concern and affects nearby residents and parked vehicles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a repeated and ongoing issue, not a one-off incident. The road surface continues to degrade due to regular commercial vehicle movements.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The affected area is close to residential properties and North Middlesex University Hospital. The situation requires inspection and appropriate action to prevent further damage to the road surface.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8636778.0.jpeg?54c938c0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Commercial Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8636778&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Unsafe and deteriorated communal estate car park surface – N178EG, 6th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8636692</link>
<description>The communal estate car park is in a poor and unsafe condition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The surface is broken and uneven in multiple areas, creating trip hazards for residents and visitors and posing a risk of damage to vehicles.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This issue has been raised previously, however only temporary repairs were carried out. The overall condition of the surface has continued to deteriorate over time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Due to the lack of proper maintenance, residents have had to carry out temporary repairs themselves in order to reduce immediate risk. These repairs were never intended to be permanent solutions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The car park now requires a formal inspection and proper repair or resurfacing to address the safety concerns.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8636692.0.jpeg?f9a94269&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Commercial Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8636692&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
