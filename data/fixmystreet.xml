<title>Light pollution from P7 50, outside 247 BR4 0HJ, 3rd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372506</link>
<description>The light from this tall lamp on PIckhurst Lane is emitted outwards, as well as down, towards the road. Strange though it might seem, it shines directly into the rear first floor bedroom at 247 BR4 0BJ and I would like it to be fitted with a baffle to prevent this continuing. I would appreciate personal contact by someone at Bromley Council to discuss this matter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8372506.0.jpeg?f9e6bc8a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pickhurst Lane, Hayes, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372506&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>30 seater coaches all day every day of the week sitting outside Westminster Choir School, 3rd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372451</link>
<description>White 30 seater coaches arrive and depart Westminster Choir Schools every day of the week. They park and run their engines, the maximum time recorded was 47mins. Once I spoke with a driver who&amp;#39;s responce was &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m heating the bus for the children. The 30 seater coaches every day is also severely blocking a very narrow road and not abling other vehicles to be able to pass by resulting in sever congestion every day. The large coaches are also blocking access to the black gates of the housing estate next door for bin removal daily. The parents also block the pavement every day three times, forcing residents to have to walk in the road, which we have to navigate two 30 seater coaches. The engine idling daily is having a serious determental effect to our residents homes and the streets flowing traffic and residents from being able to have our bins emptied and being able to park our cars and depart/arrive at our homes. The noise of beeping vehicles trying to pass and the engines has now become unbearable.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8372451.0.jpeg?2e6beb87&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Francis Street, Victoria, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372451&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

The pavements have become heavily covered with fallen leaves, creating both an unsightly mess and a potential slipping hazard for pedestrians, especially in wet conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Could the council please arrange for urgent sweeping and maintenance to clear the leaves and ensure the pavements are safe for everyone?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8372337.0.jpeg?ba333e71&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Thurlby Road, West Norwood, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372337&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
