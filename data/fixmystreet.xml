<title>Urgent Safety Concern â€“ Lack of Lane Markings at Abbey Wood Elevated Roundabout, 16th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887017</link>
<description>I am writing to formally report a serious safety concern regarding the Abbey Wood Elevated Roundabout in Belvedere/Abbey Wood.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This roundabout connects major roads including Harrow Manorway, Knee Hill, Abbey Road, Felixstowe Road, and several other important routes. Despite being a large and elevated roundabout with multiple exits, there are no lane markings within the roundabout itself. As a result, drivers are left to navigate without guidance, leading to complete disorder in lane positioning and roundabout discipline.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Everyone approaching or using this roundabout follows their own interpretation of where to drive, with no consistency or rule adherence. This creates a chaotic and dangerous environment, especially during busy periods or poor weather conditions when visibility is already compromised. The lack of markings significantly increases the risk of side-swiping, sudden lane changes, and collisions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I strongly believe this roundabout is an accident waiting to happen. Without any form of marking or directional guidance, the current state is highly unsafe for all road users, including learner drivers and those unfamiliar with the area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I urge the Council to prioritise this issue by conducting an inspection of the site and taking immediate steps to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Implement clear and standard-compliant lane markings on all approaches and within the roundabout itself. 2. Install adequate signage to guide drivers on lane selection for different exits.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I look forward to your confirmation that this concern has been formally logged and that action will be taken to address it. Thank you for your attention to this pressing safety matter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Thamesmead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887017&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Faded road markings - Chessington Avenue and Ashbourne Avenue, 16th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7886925</link>
<description>Dear Bexley Council Team,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to report an urgent issue with faded and almost non-existent road markings at the junction of Chessington Avenue and Ashbourne Avenue in Belvedere, DA17.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The give-way lines and any indication of a crossroad are extremely worn out to the point of being invisible. This is a significant safety concern, especially because:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;â€¢ The junction is a crossroad but is not visibly clear to drivers until right at the intersection. â€¢ There are no advance warning signs or clear road markings to signal the need to give way. â€¢ This junction is also part of a DVSA driving test route from the Erith Test Centre, and multiple candidates (including myself) have encountered safety and assessment challenges here due to the poor condition of the markings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This lack of visibility not only poses a risk of accidents but is also contributing to driving test failures, where candidates are unable to properly assess the junctionâ€™s priority without adequate road signage and markings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Requested Action&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I kindly request that: â€¢ The road markings are urgently repainted to clearly denote the junction and give way instructions. â€¢ Consideration is given to installing advance warning signage to indicate the presence of the crossroad.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your confirmation that this has been logged for action.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7886925.0.jpeg?2671ca69&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Chessington Avenue, Upper Belvedere, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7886925&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>This pothole between numbers 6 and 9 Warwick Road DA161SP was reported some time ago. It was patched. I was advised that it was a temporary repair, but it has since subsided.
