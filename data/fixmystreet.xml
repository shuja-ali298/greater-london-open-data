<title>Car or bus has run into the brick wall surrounding the garden causing the wall to collapse, 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8889906</link>
<description>The brick wall at the end of the road has been hit yet again by a car or bus causing major damage. There are bricks lying around. The incident happened on the 28th of January but nothing seems to have been done about it. The corner itself is very sharp and is two lanes hence its not surprising really as quite often cars speed to get through the green light. A speed camera on this section of road would reduce the risk of this happening again&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8889906.0.jpeg?dd40ec29&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): St George&#39;s Road, Elephant and Castle, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8889906&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Huge potholes, 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8889591</link>
<description>There are numerous potholes that are the whole way from Shooter’s Hill to welling high street on both sides of the road all over. This has caused damage to my tyres which I have had to spend a lot of money on to get new ones as it has taken chunks of rubber out of them. The entire road needs to be resurfaced as this is one of the main routes connecting towns and is used by all different kinds of vehicles such as cars buses and Lorries. Please can this road be resurfaced.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bellegrove Road, Falconwood, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8889591&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
