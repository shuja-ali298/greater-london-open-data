<title>Pot holes, 4th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8840442</link>
<description>Pot hole was reported o/s 48 and asphalt was put in the hole and trod down by foot. This is now starting to come away, also o/s 50 requires filling (why wasn’t this done with number 48). Filling these with asphalt trodden down by foot is not even a temporary solution, this requires a permanent solution. Why also is the debris from the holes not cleaned up.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pickford Lane, West Heath, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8840442&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pedestrian crossing outside Sainsbury&#39;s, 4th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8840335</link>
<description>The defect that used to be apparent here has returned. When the button is pressed on the Sainsbury side the wait signal lights up but it goes out after about 40 seconds, without turning the crossing to green for people to cross. When people notice they press the button again and the cycle repeats. This carried on until someone pressed from the other side of the road. Total wait time this evening approx 1 and a half minutes (I counted the seconds).&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 34-48, London Road, Forest Hill, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8840335&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous parking outside 81 Boundary Road, 4th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8840334</link>
<description>I am writing to formally request that the Council consider introducing parking restrictions on Boundary Road, DA15 8SS.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Parking problems on this road have become increasingly worse over the past year. Many residents are affected by vehicles that do not belong to local households being left parked for days at a time. These include cars, vans, and lorries from people living on nearby roads and surrounding areas, which significantly reduces available parking for residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Of particular concern is the number of lorries and large vans parking in marked bays and on road corners. This restricts visibility for drivers and pedestrians, creating a very dangerous situation, especially at junctions and bends. The ongoing congestion also causes difficulties for visitors, deliveries, and access for emergency services.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;A large number of neighbours are affected by this issue, and it is having a negative impact on both safety and quality of life for residents. I would therefore be grateful if the Council could review the situation and advise whether measures such as permit parking, time-limited parking, or other suitable restrictions could be introduced.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8840334.0.jpeg?42557cd2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 99, Boundary Road, Falconwood, Sidcup, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8840334&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
