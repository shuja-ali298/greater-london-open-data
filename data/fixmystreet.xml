<title>3 bags dumped on the pavement on Manor Way and Magpie Hall Lane., 16th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887436</link>
<description>The bags have been causing an obstruction for over a week, it’s just another issue that is ongoing beside No 38 Manor Way, which is in a shocking state and needs professional cleaning and fumigation. The pavement never gets cleaned and the garden is shocking. Would someone please help? It’s becoming unbearable and makes our area look like a tip.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7887436.0.jpeg?961e5857&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Manor Way, Southborough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887436&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree Roots causing structural damage, 16th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887340</link>
<description>The roots of this tree are damaging the structure of my wall, driveway and even house. This has been an issue we have previously reported with no followup from the council. The crack in the wall has worsen over the last year and having recently removed gravel from the driveway it has exposed that the tree roots are coming up through the drive. Additionally, we are seriously concerned the roots are damaging the house as we&amp;#39;ve notice several new big cracks over the past 6 months.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7887340.0.jpeg?db7880f4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hollies Avenue, Longlands, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887340&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Historical Fly Tipping, 16th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887306</link>
<description>My tenant has informed me that there is alot of old fly tipping that has been left to rot down the communal alley way. She is now having a heavy rodent issue due to this as apparently a chicken coup was dumped there (with loads of other things). I have asked for photos but the fly tipping is now covered in ivy so pictures do not show barely anything. Please can you send someone down to clear this as its also obstructing access, if there was to ever be a fire.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Chequers Court, Lower Belvedere, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887306&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The house at 171 Shirland Road is boarded up and appears unoccupied.
