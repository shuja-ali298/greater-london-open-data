<title>Outside nursery and gym, 28th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8790230</link>
<description>Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally report 3 blocked street drains located outside our business premises Regents Plaza. The blockage is causing water to overflow and leak down our car park walls, resulting in water ingress into our car park. This issue is now causing substantial damage to our property, and if left unresolved, there is a serious risk of further deterioration and associated costs. We consider this matter urgent and request that a representative attend the site as soon as possible to assess and rectify the problem. Please treat this as a priority to prevent further damage. I would appreciate confirmation of when this issue will be addressed. Yours Sincerely Ian Esguerra Building Manager Regents Plaza 07956 711 740 Ianodesign@yahoo.co.uk&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kilburn High Road, Kilburn, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8790230&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
