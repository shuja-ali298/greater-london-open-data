<title>Footpaths partly blocked, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985159</link>
<description>This footpath, when extended down to Pointer Close, has several sections whereby overhanging brambles, tree branches and ground level bushes should be cut back to provide full pavement-width access for pedestrians . These paths are in regular use and passing users have to quite often step into the road. These paths are next to school access roads and busy bus routes !&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Copperfield Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985159&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous footpath, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985152</link>
<description>This footpath between the care home and the school is treacherous to use. Last autumn&amp;#39;s leaves were never cleared away and much rain has made the surface very slippery (Peabody&amp;#39;s vehicles sometimes use it as a shortcut !). Consequently the leaves have become compacted and, together with the adjacent tree roots breaking the surface, make the footpath very dangerous in my opinion.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Copperfield Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985152&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Hazardous waste disposal, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985140</link>
<description>There has been an increase in post-renovation waste disposal along this road, residents have spotted tradesmen flytipping items like mattresses. A resident has recently renovated their drive way and this appeared not to far away from their house. It looks like cement which is hazaradous for people walking or cycling at night. In addition, when it falls onto the road it will be hazardous to drivers. CCTV could be a solution&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8985140.0.jpeg?04f7b880&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): St Andrews Close, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985140&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Group 1 Volkswagen dealership parking on double yellows, 24th February</title>

<description>I have reported this so many times now. There is double yellow lines for a reason and you have group one Volkswagen dealership parking their vehicles on double yellow lines causing an obstruction. These vehicles are left there all day long and it makes dangerous for cars pulling out from the side roads as the visibility is reduced.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8985061.0.jpeg?c9abfcf3&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Avondale Road, Plaistow, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985061&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flytipping in bin enclosure outside Dawes House, 23rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985031</link>
<description>The flytipping took place on 23/2/2026. I heard a lot of noise and went outside to see what was going on, and saw someone get into a large white box van that had been parked right in front of the rubbish disposal area where the goods had been flytipped. They then drove away towards the exit onto Orb Street. The time was about 23:14. The flytipped goods have filled the entire rubbish area and include a mattress, a bedframe, a cupboard, rolled up carpet, various plastic bags and wooden planks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8985031.0.jpeg?37b85256&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Orb Street, Walworth, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985031&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Chesterfield Grove Along Wall of Joe the Juice shop (opposite the car wash)-Flytipping- 5th Complaint, 23rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985030</link>
<description>5th Complaint: A large cardboard box iand a large metal shelf with sharp edges dumped has now been added to the pile. They both can fall on pedestrians. There are 2 pellats that could also fall on pedestrians. 2 chairs dumped, where one has been blown over and could have hurt pedestrians. (10th complaint) where furniture should be appropriately disposed of, in addition to a black bag. It is completely unacceptable that this is a site for dumping of rubbish and nothing is being done about the removal of them, which will encourage more flytipping. The Duty of Care is not being demonstrated of not enforcing the law towards the organisation in regards to the responsible manner of rubbish disposal/removal. Health and safety of the residents and wider community should be paramount, not ignored.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8985030.0.jpeg?8f1e4121&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 25, Chesterfield Grove, East Dulwich, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985030&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
