<title>The street drain is obviously blocked, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8913250</link>
<description>As of heavy rain yesterday the drain is overflowing at one point the water was across to other side of rd and entering my drive way this took several hours to clear . But once again after rain this morning we are in the same position , at the moment it’s still quite deep . The drain itself is outside my neighbours house no 8 elmwood drive , I did notice that when the drain cleaner was going along pumping out the drains last time this one was missed . Would appreciate if this could be sorted before we get in the position of more heavy rain &amp;amp; flooding our properties Await your reply .&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 10, Elmwood Drive, Albany Park, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8913250&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
