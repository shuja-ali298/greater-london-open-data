<title>Inadequate signal timing, 4th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7977472</link>
<description>I am reporting that the current crossing timing for pedestrians for the intersection of Green Lane and Penge High Street is not adequate for pedestrians to cross safely. The intersection gives you a count down from 11seconds. At the start of 11 seconds count down there are still approximately 30 steps still required when crossing the intersection diagonally (the crossing diagonally is approx 47 steps). I am a fit person and can do this walk quickly and I still have 30 steps required to get to the curb. There are many older or less able bodied people who cross this intersection along with school children and parents with children. The count down for this intersection needs approx another 5 seconds for safe crossing. If you compare this intersection with the Beckenham A215 / Albemarle intersection (which is much smaller than the Penge High Street crossing) the count down for pedestrians starts at 15 seconds, the crossing diagonally is approx 40 steps and when you make the opposite curb you still have approx 10 seconds left for crossing from the count down. Can we please get an increase for this intersection as it truly is a safety risk. It is a true danger and you constantly see uncomfortable situations of people still crossing when the traffic starts to move. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Croydon Road, Penge, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7977472&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Brixham road-full road needs re-surfacing, 4th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7977458</link>
<description>Its been reported that brixham road needs a full re-surface. There is no avoiding the pot holes, the shallows and just the overall uneven surface of the road and its damaging cars, its something that has been like this for around 10 years or more Its not nice for the residents that have to live there. the residents would believe its more beneficial to close the road and fix the whole road than parts of it like whats been done already. can this please be looked into as the whole road needs to be looked at.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Selsey Crescent, West Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7977458&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
