<title>Overhanging, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7782060</link>
<description>Tree on public green on the corner of stansted crescent and carisbrooke ave is over hanging my property at no 79 stansted crescent. We are constantly removing tree debris from the garage roof and unblocking gutters. It has now grown over the fence line and over hanging out buildings We have permission to construct a new build property in place of the garage and we would appreciate if the tree was fully felled and reduced as to not cause any future issues. If it could be removed then great but if not to have the overall scale reduced and maintained would be much appreciated&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7782060.0.jpeg?6895cadc&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 80, Carisbrooke Avenue, Albany Park, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7782060&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Further Fly tipping piled onto of council notified existing fly tipping, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7782044</link>
<description>Additional Flytipped rubbish piled on top of old fly tipped of already flytipped rubbish that has been put in K&amp;amp;C’s ‘Bad Rubbish’ bags. Makes a mockery of K&amp;amp;C’s efforts. Solution - since all flytipped bags are put by lampposts so put signs on the lamp posts printed in clear orange or yellow indicating it is illegal rubbish and a fineable offence to fly top. These pictures are taken outside no. 52 Cranley Gardens. Tonight at 6.20pm there are four separate piles of over 16 bags along the street from multiple properties. Outside nos 3, 32, 42, 52 This has to stop. piles of rubbish and spilled food shredded by animals. Disgusting. It makes the area look like a slum and is dangerous to slip on. The K&amp;amp;C rubbish collectors will clear it tomorrow morning as that is the collection day. By the time the council come to inspect this complaint they later report there was nothing there as the refuse teams will have collected on Monday and the matter is closed which is absurd as they have not stopped or followed up on addressed evidence in the bags of who is the cause of fly tipping. Please can the council be more proactive or engage residents to put clear adhesive signs showing it is an offence to fly tip and list collection days on it. The current ‘Bad Rubbish’ bags are too lame and not visible enough. Flytipping is a findable offence so state it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7782044.0.jpeg?9a7147bf&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 22, Cranley Gardens, Brompton, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7782044&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Regular weekend Fly tipping outside 42/44 Cranley Gardens., 29th June</title>

<description>Regular flytipped rubbish at weekends outside collection times by selfish resident (shown on address in rubbish) yet again appearing on pavement outside 42/40 Cranley Gardens lamppost tonight at 6.20pm. Tonight at 6.20pm there are four separate piles of over 16 bags along the street from multiple properties. Outside nos 3, 32, 42, 52 This has to stop piles of rubbish and spilled food shredded by animals. Disgusting. It makes the area look like a slum and is dangerous to slip on. The K&amp;amp;C rubbish collectors will clear it tomorrow morning as that is the collection day on Monday but rubbish gets left out all weekend and not put in basement cupboards if the buildings. This is getting worse &amp;amp; worse. By the time the council come to inspect this complaint they later report there was nothing there as the refuse teams will of course have collected on Monday and the matter is closed which is absurd as they have not stopped or followed up on addressed evidence in the bags &amp;amp; who is the cause of fly tipping.
