<title>Foliage still blocking light, 30th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8483844</link>
<description>The giant hedge from the house next to the alleyway was trimmed last week, but the top was left and this is the part that still blocks the light from brightening the Durban Road end of the alleyway! It’s absolutely pitch black between the two houses and with the gas flue on the side of the house at 82, it’s very dangerous. There needs to be more light in the alleyway.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8483844.0.jpeg?e27c1b73&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Durban Road, Beckenham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8483844&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
