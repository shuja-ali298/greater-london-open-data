<title>Street light not working, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679756</link>
<description>Three lamp posts are not working under the flyover, the area is extremely dark and potentially dangerous in the evenings and at night. The area is already poorly lit, so without these lampposts you cannot use this route in the evenings.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8679756.0.jpeg?07dc38f6&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Thamesmead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679756&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Blocked drain when heavy rain falls causing flooding and public unable to walk past, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679663</link>
<description>One drain covering the broadway and Harcourt road, whenever we have heavy rainfall the drain cannot cope with it and flooding causes the pavement to become impassable due to the amount of water that gets splashed over. This has been going on for years and should have sorted a long time ago. its very unsafe for anyone trying to walk past.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Harcourt Road, Blendon, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679663&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Graffiti on roof of commercial building, highly visible from main road, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679484</link>
<description>Graffiti has been sprayed on both sides of the main pitched roof and on the rear flat roof of a commercial building at 2–4 Upper Wickham Lane, Welling DA16 3HE.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The graffiti is at roof level and is clearly visible from Upper Wickham Lane, which is a busy main road with high pedestrian and vehicle traffic. Due to the height and location, specialist access is required to remove it safely.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The issue was discovered on 10 January 2026 and has been reported to the Metropolitan Police. This report is made because of the prominence of the graffiti and its impact on the street scene.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8679484.0.jpeg?00a45a45&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 7, Coton Road, Welling, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679484&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Enormous sinkhole rapidly expanding, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679476</link>
<description>This sinkhole has been a problem for at least a year. A patch was done on top but very obviously did not fix the issue as it is a sinkhole underneath not just broken road. The patch has now failed and holes are opening up. I can just about drive around it with the car but buses are driving over it every day. The council risks a very expensive liability claim should the sinkhole open with a driver overtop, potentially causing injury or death to drivers, and catastrophic damage to the vehicle above. Surely it is best to fix properly than risk someone&amp;#39;s life or limb.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Barnfield Gardens, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679476&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Id Verde vehicles using grass areas as a short cut, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679414</link>
<description>The id Verde personnel who empty the Kelsey Park litter bins frequently cut across grass areas in their vehicles. Here are two photos the first was taken not far from the Stone Park Avenue (SPA) gate on the west side of the park and the other not far from the gate accessing the shops in Wickham Road. Also I have noticed that just in side the SPA gate where there is a park litter bin the personnel drive the vehicle right up to the bin and then drive the vehicle across the conservation area there damaging the grass and bulbs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8679414.0.jpeg?ba54ec1c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Stone Park Avenue, Eden Park, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679414&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Outside 28 Chalcot Square, 13th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679404</link>
<description>For the past two days, the road and access to Chalcot Square have been completely blocked for extended periods of time (not for a few minutes, but for hours). This has prevented vehicles from entering or leaving the square and has caused significant disruption to residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition, the pavement has been constantly blocked, forcing pedestrians into the road. Large vehicles associated with the works at no 28 are also being driven and reversed the wrong way around the square, creating an unsafe and unacceptable situation.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If the contractors require dedicated space to carry out these works, they should be required to suspend parking bays through the proper channels and operate in a lawful and managed way. At present, the situation feels unmanaged and is becoming increasingly ridiculous.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate the council urgently investigating this matter and taking appropriate enforcement action to prevent further obstruction and ensure safety for residents and pedestrians.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8679404.0.jpeg?851ad728&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Chalcot Square, Chalk Farm, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8679404&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
