<description>The laurel hedge along the roadside looks to have been removed. Has this been done by the Council and, if so, is it to be replaced?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8557109.0.jpeg?88bf17f2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 33, Wickham Way, Park Langley, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8557109&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dead fox, 16th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8557061</link>
<description>Perfect fox that has clearly been hit by a car and abandoned to die. Rigor mortis has already set in. So sad. Very close to the entrance of Queenscroft Park. In the road, right next to the kerb.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8557061.0.jpeg?92a22347&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Queenscroft Road, Eltham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8557061&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>On building site shields, 16th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8557059</link>
<description>I can see this is beyond the ability of the Council’s team to repaint or remove. The graffiti on this building site - as pictured and more - needs to be better managed by the site owner. Please would you get onto them!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8557059.0.jpeg?171c0d63&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Elephant and Castle, Elephant and Castle, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8557059&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Faraday Memorial substation graffiti, 16th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8557057</link>
<description>The last time this was graffitied it took several weeks to be cleaned. Almost the moment it was cleaned off, the graffiti has been reapplied.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I imagine that Southwark views it as ‘not Southwark’s responsibility. It is a shame as more generally graffiti in the area is well down since the Council really took hold of it, an impressive achievement of the Council team which is much appreciated by local residents. Is it possible for the Council to negotiate with the owner of this - TFL/ Underground maybe? - to ensure that graffiti on this building is better managed? It’s such a shame as the rest of the area is well managed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8557057.0.jpeg?d48d256e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Elephant and Castle, Elephant and Castle, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8557057&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Urgent Refuse Mismanagement &amp; Fly-tipping Hazard, 16th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8556886</link>
<description>I am writing to report a serious and recurring issue of refuse mismanagement, which is now creating a significant environmental hazard and public nuisance on the street. The residents have repeatedly placed their refuse bins out on the wrong days, and this time, they have put all their four black bins out during the recycling week (the wrong week) and have severely overfilled them. They also added an extra, non-standard bin, which was quickly torn open by foxes, spreading large amounts of litter across the public pathway and street. This widespread mess is attracting rodents and poses a health risk to the public. Things will only get worse, as when the correct collection day for general waste arrives next week, the bins will be rejected by the collection crew because they are overfilled and incorrectly presented. This failure to collect will leave a substantial volume of waste uncollected and overflowing on the pavement throughout the Christmas period, causing a prolonged and severe nuisance for all neighbours and pedestrians. I urge your team to take corrective action to prevent a prolonged unsanitary situation over the holidays. Thank you for your prompt attention.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8556886.0.jpeg?ca2ce917&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Randlesdown Road, Southend, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8556886&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Over hanging branches and deadwood coming into the road, 16th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8556879</link>
<description>On the way up to the station from the mini roundabout there is a lot of fallen dead wood and lose branches overhanging and landing in the road. It’s worst on the bend which causes traffic to brake or swerve. Residents are occasionally pushing the large branches up the verge but they come back down in the winds. Needs clearing back before there is an accident.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Elmstead Lane, Elmstead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8556879&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Loads of dog mess on the street, 16th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8556873</link>
<description>There are two loads of dog mess on the corner of Townley St and Morecambe St. They have been there for around 2 weeks now, to the point where mold is now growing on the dog mess.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I&amp;#39;ll spare you a gross photo, but can someone come and clean this? Might be worth putting a few signs telling people to clean up after their dog. It&amp;#39;s disgusting and happens semi-regularly.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Townley Street, Walworth, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8556873&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Manhole cover clicking at every car, 16th December</title>
