<title>Hampstead road, 14th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416852</link>
<description>Hampstead Road (A400) regularly suffers long delays and queues, particularly around the Robert Street junction. Temporary signals/works are causing vehicles to block side roads and pedestrian crossings, creating dangerous conditions for pedestrians and cyclists and delaying emergency vehicles. Please investigate signal timing, consider traffic-calming or stewarding, or just get a move on with the work.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hampstead Road, Fitzrovia, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416852&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous slippery Road,, 13th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416834</link>
<description>All of Derwin Road is covered in leaves. They are wet and slippery and need cleanup. The road is not been cleaned for months. This is the last road in the borough and is always left out. There is so many piles of leaves that that it is stopping residents from being able to park. The reason I ask for the road is sweat manually is there is many pavement extensions is supposed to slow the traffic down and the road grooves in and out and the machine cannot get into the grooves. It seems that the machines just push all the leaves to one area and when it hits a groove, it doesn’t pick them up so it’s best to say the old-fashioned way a person and a broom will be perfect for the job. The leaves are very slippery and as mentioned earlier at so many piles are in the road. Could you please arrange for somebody to come and sweep the road manually and by doing it manually they will be able to get into the gutters where a lot of the leaves are….. Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Derwent Road, Anerley, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416834&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Drains need cleaning in Netherlands Road near Oakleigh Park Station, 13th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416816</link>
<description>Monday 10th November 2025. Walked along Netherlands Rd from Temple Ave to Oakleigh Park station. Only the central third of the carriageway was above water because all the drains were blocked. Every car that passed sent a wall of water over the pavement and over any pedestrians on it as there is no way of escape. We were soaked and the water was dripping off us and our shoes were full of water. These drains are frequently blocked. Either they are insufficient in number or they need clearing out more often. Ironically two to three weekends beforehand the drains in Temple Ave had been cleared as they are inaccessible on weekdays due to parked cars. There is no such reason for not clearing the drains in Netherlands Rd.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 118, Netherlands Road, East Barnet, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8416816&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
