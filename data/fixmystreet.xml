<title>Bollard knocked down outside 182 Rowley Avenue Sidcup, 4th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7811301</link>
<description>Bollard knocked down. Happened several times in a few months. Needs to be put back in other wise cars come up on the pavement and this is a danger to pedestrians. Knocked down outside 182 Rowley Avenue, Sidcup. I had reported a few months back and got report back saying it had been fixed but it hadn&amp;#39;t. We have propped it up in the hole for now to prevent cars coming up on the curb/pavement but it is not secured in the concrete. Please can someone look at this as a matter of urgency and can they secure it. Whoever checked it before may not have checked it correctly. Whilst it&amp;#39;s now standing up in the hole it&amp;#39;s in no way secure or safe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The report&amp;#39;s reference number is 7182713. Please quote this if you need to contact the council about this report.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7811301.0.jpeg?5f29fc48&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 180, Rowley Avenue, Blendon, Sidcup, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7811301&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Antisocial behaviour, 4th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7811299</link>
<description>Along the Surrey Canal Walk there are groups that gather under both bridges using drugs and is very intimidating to walk through in the morning and I’m sure at other times of the day. I have had to call the police due to this and have seen the police there on many occasions and it does feel unsafe.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Surrey Canal Walk, Old Kent Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7811299&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fly tipping of builders waste, 4th July</title>

<description>Hi! Please see image of fly tipping. There&amp;#39;s actually quite a lot of rubbish on this road and really bad fly-tipping within the close proximity. It would be great if something could be done about it.

<title>Complaint, 4th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7811209</link>
<description>Please see original complaint:494837 for reference prior to below.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Further to my complaint dated 5th February 2025, I must express my deep disappointment regarding the way this matter has been handled. It is wholly unacceptable that it has taken over five months for Bromley Council to take action in response to an issue we raised immediately after the incident.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;My husband continues to suffer significant discomfort and mobility issues as a result of the serious shoulder injury he sustained due to the dangerous condition of the pavement on Eden Way. At the time, both my daughter and I contacted you to report this incident and make you aware of the severe impact it had on our family. Despite this, the matter was initially dismissed, seemingly on the grounds that multiple complaints had not been made—an incredibly frustrating and insensitive response given the circumstances.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We experienced, firsthand, the distress and complications that followed—emergency treatment, surgery, and prolonged recovery, all stemming from a hazard that could and should have been addressed promptly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is only now, five months later, that the council has chosen to acknowledge the issue and accept responsibility. This delay is not only unacceptable but has also compounded the suffering endured by my husband and our family.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would appreciate a formal response outlining the steps Bromley Council intends to take both to resolve this matter and to ensure similar failures do not occur in future.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7811209.0.jpeg?7adb8695&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Eden Way, Eden Park, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7811209&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
