<title>Flytipping in bin enclosure outside Dawes House, 23rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985031</link>
<description>The flytipping took place on 23/2/2026. I heard a lot of noise and went outside to see what was going on, and saw someone get into a large white box van that had been parked right in front of the rubbish disposal area where the goods had been flytipped. They then drove away towards the exit onto Orb Street. The time was about 23:14. The flytipped goods have filled the entire rubbish area and include a mattress, a bedframe, a cupboard, rolled up carpet, various plastic bags and wooden planks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8985031.0.jpeg?37b85256&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Orb Street, Walworth, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985031&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Chesterfield Grove Along Wall of Joe the Juice shop (opposite the car wash)-Flytipping- 5th Complaint, 23rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985030</link>
<description>5th Complaint: A large cardboard box iand a large metal shelf with sharp edges dumped has now been added to the pile. They both can fall on pedestrians. There are 2 pellats that could also fall on pedestrians. 2 chairs dumped, where one has been blown over and could have hurt pedestrians. (10th complaint) where furniture should be appropriately disposed of, in addition to a black bag. It is completely unacceptable that this is a site for dumping of rubbish and nothing is being done about the removal of them, which will encourage more flytipping. The Duty of Care is not being demonstrated of not enforcing the law towards the organisation in regards to the responsible manner of rubbish disposal/removal. Health and safety of the residents and wider community should be paramount, not ignored.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8985030.0.jpeg?8f1e4121&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 25, Chesterfield Grove, East Dulwich, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8985030&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Uncollected rubbish 2nd report . Rats and foxes running around . Been there months . The school takes no responsibility, 23rd February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8984467</link>
<description>I reported this serious problem months ago and you sent a residential person to look at it . He couldn’t do anything because it’s a school rubbish bin next to a residential block . It’s disgusting and the school needs to take responsibility for this area after it’s been cleared up . Please sort this out before a child is bitten by a rat or a fox . Both are seen around the rubbish . Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8984467.0.jpeg?d4ba187d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lockyer Estate, The Borough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8984467&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
