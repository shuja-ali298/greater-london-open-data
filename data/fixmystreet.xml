<title>The lamppost is has been hit several times and therefore left at a slant and believe electricts inside it are damaged vecause of it as often flickers and can hear buzzing inside and rattling in the wind, 22nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8745655</link>
<description>The lamppost located directly outside the front of our property has been repeatedly struck by supermarket delivery vehicles and other large vans. Its current position places it in a vulnerable spot, especially given the high number of cars that park along the roadside. When delivery drivers attempt to turn or reverse, the lamppost is frequently hit, which has resulted in the damage and instability visible today. For safety reasons and to prevent further incidents, I request that the lamppost be replaced and repositioned. Moving it slightly further along, in line with the boundary between our property and our neighbour’s, would place it out of the usual turning area for vehicles and significantly reduce the risk of future collisions. Relocating the lamppost to this alternative position would improve safety for both residents and drivers while ensuring the infrastructure remains protected and functional.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8745655.0.jpeg?077601a2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Inglewood Road, Barnehurst, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8745655&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Commercial vehicles continuosly parking on the road, 22nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8745613</link>
<description>The amount of commercial vehicles parked on this road has increased recently. It&amp;#39;s very dangerous because of the two schools we have. I believe it might have something to do with what happened on valley road recently. This road is getting very dangerous and it&amp;#39;s just a matter of time before an accident happens. I know because I had a car crash onto my drive and took out my car two years ago. I&amp;#39;m not sure but is it true that a labour counsellor had something done on valley road because he was unhappy with the parking. If so it&amp;#39;s moved the problem here because people are parking on this road instead. Bring in pay and display we all have driveways here&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8745613.0.jpeg?a351a32d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Valleyfield Road, Streatham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8745613&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Big broken cover on pavement outside 30 Underhill Road., 22nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8745468</link>
<description>It has been there for a month. I reported it to the council and it was temporarily covered but not repaired. The cover is outside a car entrance and it keeps moving around. It is also a block away from a home for visually impaired people and it’s very close to the P13 bus stop, so it’s a danger for pedestrians.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8745468.0.jpeg?75495589&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Underhill Road, East Dulwich, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8745468&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dog fouling near fosters school, 22nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8745466</link>
<description>Hello,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I’d like to report a dog fouling hotspot on Westbrooke Road (Welling/Falconwood), on the school-run route near Foster’s School.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I’ve noticed dog mess being left on/near front garden edges and pavements along Westbrooke Road, particularly around school-run times (roughly 08:15–09:00 and 14:45–15:30). This is a hygiene and safety issue given the number of children using the route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please could this location be logged as a hotspot and considered for targeted action (e.g., signage and occasional enforcement/warden presence around drop-off/pick-up times)?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Westbrooke Road, Welling, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8745466&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
