<description>Every week local people decide to dump their domestic waste and dog bags outside the primary school.

<title>Fridge, mattress, bed base dumped under the railway bridge on Urlwin Street., 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8296076</link>
<description>I posted (Sat 11th Oct 2025) that two large fridges had been dumped under the railway bridge on Urlwin Street. Your update states that that the “case has been fixed and is closed.” However, one has gone but the other FRIDGE is still there (see photo). A MATTRESS and BED BASE and DUVET have now joined the remaining fridge. Please could they all be removed.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8296076.0.jpeg?15563e76&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Urlwin Street, Camberwell, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8296076&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree stays need moving to help tree grow upright, 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295959</link>
<description>The young tree is a replacement for the tree cut down last autumn. It was an important Winter habitat for immigrating starlings. I fear this young tree will soon be causing a danger if left to grow at a jaunty angle unchecked. Is there any chance you could encourage it to grow more upright? Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8295959.0.jpeg?8d702be4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Branston Crescent, Poverest, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295959&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Every day cyclists go through the red lights and pedestrians are in danger, 14th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295944</link>
<description>I have been living on Borough High Street for over three years, and I often return home from work on the 133 bus, getting off at Union Street (Stop G). As I cross the intersection of Union Street and Borough High Street, as well as Newcomen Street, I consistently observe cyclists and e-scooter riders ignoring the red light and pedestrian signals. This behavior poses a significant danger to both motorists and pedestrians. A collision between a cyclist and a pedestrian can lead to severe injuries or even death. Furthermore, e-bikes and e-scooters can reach much higher speeds, increasing the risk for pedestrians. I am incredibly frustrated and anxious about crossing the road to get home safely.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Union Street, The Borough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8295944&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Metropolitan police officer breaking the law. Metropolitan police cycling up Well street middle of Road on one-way system Road.Nearly into oncoming vehicle. I stopped and let him pass but he should not be coming up one way road. Yes, the one-way system on Well Street also applies to cyclists, meaning it is illegal for them to go the wrong way unless a specific sign indicates an exception. While some one-way streets in London have been made two-way for cyclists, this is not standard and must be clearly marked with signage, which you would need to check for on Well Street. Hackney Council if you could Mark this better please for offices to understand., 14th October</title>
