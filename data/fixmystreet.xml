<title>I’ve reported this, but a local restaurant is dumping their restaurant waste, including oil, 11th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8535749</link>
<description>I’m reporting repeated incidents of illegal commercial waste dumping by food trucks operating at 103 Union Street, London SE1 0LA, managed by Samsite Ltd (one of the 9 vendors operating out of the site is dumping here). They have been regularly discarding meat waste, used oil cans, and other rubbish into the residential bins outside my property. We have had more rats, oil spills and rotten food smell from the waste that they are putting in the residential bins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This has caused overflowing bins, strong smells, and hygiene issues. As per the Environmental Protection Act 1990, commercial waste must not be disposed of in domestic bins, and this activity amounts to fly-tipping.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I took these pictures this evening of these bins overflowing with mostly oil cans this time. I have previous pictures of the guys dumping rotten food, and hazardous waste from the food into the bins (including videos of where they are coming out of). This is the white van that comes up multiple times a week and I got their license plate number. They dump at least three times a week filling up our residential garbage cans.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8535749.0.jpeg?e7d53c61&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Southwark Bridge Road, The Borough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8535749&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flytipping Hot Spot side of Candy Box Maple Crescent, 11th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8535650</link>
<description>A child&amp;#39;s car seat has been dumped at the location. Further along by the green junction box there is an accumulation of broken glass bottles and empty alcohol glass bottles purchased from the Candy Box on the pavement. Please can this be cleaned as soon as possible. This is a constant problem so some robust enforcement is required please. Could I suggest that when the shopping Parade is swept by the street cleaning team they can carry out an overlap and check and remove any items of litter from the side of the Candy Box.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Maple Crescent, Blackfen, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8535650&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Multiple Cars without registration plate, 11th December</title>

<description>There are multiple cars without registration plate larked on Riverdale Road for months next to a “pavement garage shop” which always completely block the pavement access to the puplic. Vehicles ae untaxed and uninsured and should not be parked on public roads. Also that garage business should not be allowed to operate as it exploit public pavements and parking spaces. Also it does not looks like that any fire safety are in place there.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8535489.0.jpeg?713a207c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Saunders Road, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8535489&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
