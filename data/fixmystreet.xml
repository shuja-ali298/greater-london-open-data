<title>This sign and bay are misleading and misrepresentative to residents leading to the issuance of PCN’s, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8239980</link>
<description>This bay has NO ACTIVE CHARGING POINT that would allow it to act as a proper EV space. As such it is confusing to those of us who are B permit holders and EV car owners and has lead to numerous PCN’s for using the space without an active charge. Either the sign should be removed or a working charging point should be installed. As it stands it can’t be used as a charging spot or a parking space which penalises us as residents.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8239980.0.jpeg?522a7ee3&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 49, Talbot Road, Maida Hill, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8239980&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Van appears to be abandoned too close to junction, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8239925</link>
<description>This van was parked up about a month ago and we have not seen anyone else go to it and it hasn&amp;#39;t been moved at all. Due to the close proximity to the school and where it is parked right at the end of the junction we are concerned about childrens safety being dropped off and collected from school and would be grateful if you could check the status on this vehicle please.

<title>Scaffolding on both sides, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8239897</link>
<description>There is scaffolding on both sides of Vigo street at the moment which is extremely DANGEROUS as the middle road is a cycle lane! People cycle really fast here and its extremely unsafe for the public. At many instances have people been run over (an old guy fell over and started bleeding the other day) and since there is a lot of foot traffic there you should make it a pedestrian street only for safety until the works are done. The bikers are not careful at all, I live around the corner and I have a toddler. Its extremely unsafe. Do something about it until the works are done.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8239897.0.jpeg?badbcec8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 9, Vigo Street, Mayfair, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8239897&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
