<title>No street lights, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705474</link>
<description>There is no street light on the corner of Edmund Street and New Church Road (by Evalina Mansions). Coupled with no lights on the foot and bike path between Addington Square and New Church Road (right by the playground), this means that it’s incredibly dark in the evening and at night. It feels very unsafe, especially given the crime in and around Burgess Park.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 74, Edmund Street, Camberwell, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705474&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree about to fall over, 16th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705413</link>
<description>The tree is ripping out of the ground. This has been ongoing for ages. I complained last year and all they done was come and cut a couple of branches and removed 2 slabs, filling it with sand and stones. The tree has got progressively worse over the past couple of days, the roots are ripping out and the pavement is lifting. If this tree falls it is going seriously hurt someone and cause damage to vehicles parked or passing!! It needs to be removed asap.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8705413.0.jpeg?cb319356&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 6, Dartmouth Park Hill, Archway, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8705413&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
