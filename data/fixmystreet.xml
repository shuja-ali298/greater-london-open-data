<description>Please could you put up some more signs in Ashmore Road, Bravington Road, Denholm Road, Fernhead Road, Fordingley Road, Portnal Road, Saltram Crescent and Shirland Road. Encouraging dog owners to clean up after their dogs. Some signs have been removed by dog owners who have taken offence. These individuals are grossly irresponsible! These streets are vast becoming a cesspit!! Warlock Road is also a road that needs some of these signs to be put up encouraging dog owners to clean up after their dogs. I feel that if possible, could you send some of your Wardens, to keep an eye on things in these streets. The culprits need to be caught and banged to rights!!Thank you in anticipation.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 95, Fernhead Road, Kensal Town, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691356&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691339</link>
<description>Please could you put up some signs opposite St Luke&amp;#39;s Church of England primary school encouraging dog owners to clean up after their dogs. There needs to be some signs on both sides of Fernhead Road. Because this is becoming a problem again. Some of the signs that have been put up have been taken down, or moved to the level of the pavement by irresponsible dog owners who have taken offence. Fernhead Road is particularly bad with dog fouling especially towards the middle end of Fernhead Road and towards the Harrow Road end. More signs need to be put up. In a bid to clean up Fernhead Road. Thank you in anticipation.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 95, Fernhead Road, Kensal Town, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691339&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
