<title>Pothole around 40cm wide and 10cm deep, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857634</link>
<description>I am writing to report a pothole on Kingsland Road, London, specifically outside the properties numbered 321-325 Kingsland Road, postcode E8 4DL.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pothole appears quite deep and deteriorating. It poses a significant hazard to vehicles (risk of tyre damage, loss of control, especially for cyclists and motorbikes) and could cause accidents if not addressed promptly, particularly during wet weather or at night.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It causes severe dirt and splashes of gravel on to our window, doors and shutters and leaving the entrance to our business ruined. We are losing customers on a daily basis and have to pay a cleaning firm to come and clean all the time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I believe this requires urgent attention as it is worsening and could lead to injury and further damage. If possible, please prioritise an inspection and repair.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For reference:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Location: Kingsland Road, outside 321-325&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Approximate size/depth: around 40cm wide and 10cm deep.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Date observed: 31th of January 2026&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Additional notes: please see attached images and videos&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please confirm receipt of this report and provide a reference number if you have a tracking system. I would appreciate any update on when an inspection or repair might take place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your prompt attention to this safety issue.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8857634.0.jpeg?9f6a21be&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 321, Kingsland Road, Haggerston, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857634&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Side of 45 Littlemede, bushes overgrown across footway, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857435</link>
<description>I have been reporting this for about 3 years now. Concrete fence post is completely broken at the bottom and along with the rest of hedging, it’s falling across the footway. We have people with severe disabilities that use this stretch, a seriously dangerous obstacle for them especially when vehicle are parked there. This has to be dealt with immediately.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8857435.0.jpeg?eae0e46d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Littlemede, Eltham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857435&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Extremely noisy manhole cover, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857342</link>
<description>There is a noisy manhole cover on Norman Road, directly in front of the large construction site known as Saxon Wharf. When vehicles pass over it, it produces an extremely loud, sudden noise, which is particularly disruptive at night. The sound is sharp and explosive — similar to a gunshot — and it regularly wakes residents from sleep, often causing alarm and distress. This issue has been reported to Thames Water &amp;amp; Greenwich council by residents several times but unfortunately the issue still persists. This is becoming increasingly concerning, not only because of the ongoing noise disturbance and distress, but also due to the difficulty in getting a response to what should be a relatively straightforward maintenance issue. Please could you fix it immediately? Note: this eve a person was seen on site placing wedges around the manhole which only worked, as reported by another resident before me, only.for 10.minutes. This manhole needs replacing for the residents mental wellbeing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Norman Road, Greenwich&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857342&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Hello&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Despite several reports provided by other in the neighbourhood on no lights over St Xaviour&amp;#39;s foot bridge, the Council has just not bothered to do anything.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can the Council address this as a matter of urgency and not wait until police reports are filed when robbing takes place. The area is very dark and unsafe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 26, Shad Thames, Bermondsey, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857309&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
