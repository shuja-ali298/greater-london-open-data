<title>Old car causing air and noise pollution by revving the engine, 8th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7829803</link>
<description>I am writing to formally raise a concern about a serious case of air and noise pollution caused by a car idling near Westminster School during school dismissal hours.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Earlier today, I observed an old car near the school with its engine continuously idling. The driver, a woman wearing a feathered hat, kept aggressively revving the engine even while stationary, producing thick exhaust fumes and excessive noise. She appeared angry, having already shouted at another driver, which made it difficult to approach her directly. The smell of the exhaust was strong and unpleasant, clearly affecting pedestrians nearby. Children walking home from school were visibly uncomfortable, some pinching their noses to avoid breathing in the fumes. A woman with a pram was also seen trying to shield herself and her child from the polluted air as she walked past.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This incident occurred in a busy, pedestrian-heavy area close to a school, making it especially concerning due to the presence of young children. The impact was both auditory and environmental, with the engine noise and exhaust fumes contributing to significant public discomfort. This raises questions about whether the vehicle in question has passed a valid MOT test, considering the level of emissions and engine condition.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Detailed Summary: An old car was observed excessively idling and revving near Westminster School, releasing heavy exhaust fumes and creating noise pollution during school pick-up hours. This posed a health risk to children and other pedestrians. The driver&amp;#39;s aggressive behavior prevented public intervention. I urge the council to investigate whether this vehicle complies with emissions standards and to enforce stricter controls on idling and polluting vehicles near school streets. Please take appropriate action to investigate and prevent such incidents in the future&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): John Islip Street, Millbank, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7829803&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
