<title>Human urine on common stairs, 21st October</title>

<description>Someone or some people keep urinating in the common entrance way and on the stairs of Scriven Court flats. There are in two different locations. It&amp;#39;s unsafe and unsanitary. The Council needs to adopt strategies that can prevent this anti-social behaviour.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8323701.0.jpeg?220827eb&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Livermere Road, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8323701&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Once again, cyclists’ lives are being put at risk by thoughtless roadworks by UK Power Networks, with zero safe provision for cyclists as required by TfL’s Roadworks Charter, which they have signed up to., 21st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8323687</link>
<description>Once again, a “cycle lane closed” sign has appeared blocking Cycleway 10, this time at the junction of The Strand and Bow Street, at the north end of Waterloo bridge. There is no warning, diversion or any other safety measures in place, leaving northbound cyclists stranded in the middle of a very busy junction with no clue as to where they are supposed to go – a very dangerous situation indeed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Southbound, a sign reads “Diversion” but with no arrows or indication where on earth that diversion is supposed to be.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a very busy cycle route used by 8,500 cyclist per day. Closing it entirely across this junction a ludicrous and unnecessary decision which introduces a huge danger to cyclists, including children, using this supposedly safe route.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Was TfL consulted about this route closure? Were cyclists consulted? How long is it to be closed for? Was a risk assessment even completed?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;UK Power Networks has signed up to TfL’s Roadworks Charter, vowing that “We will follow the guidance from the TfL Traffic Management Handbook” and “We will ensure the safety of all vulnerable road users”.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;UK Power Networks and Westminster Council have a duty of care to protect vulnerable road users, but don’t seem to have actually read the TfL Traffic Management Handbook (or the Charter) let alone acted upon it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8323687.0.jpeg?1772c17c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lancaster Place, Holborn, City of Westminster&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8323687&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Inadequate Lighting - Kilburn Pl - Part 2, 21st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8323652</link>
<description>Thank you for your response (through report : 8321037). I appreciate the time and effort. Thanks for confirming that the lighting on Kilburn Pl meets the current BS 5489:2020 standard. However, while it may comply technically, the practical reality is that the street remains poorly lit, with significant dark spots that compromise safety and continue to attract antisocial and illegal behaviour. Standards aside, the existing three lanterns are insufficient to provide consistent, even illumination along the entire stretch. I therefore request that the council reconsider this matter from a community safety perspective, rather than solely a compliance one, and carry out a further review to identify where additional lighting could be installed to improve security for residents and visitors. I urge you to perform another review\assessment (if feasible during late hours) and you notice that light (especially towards the middle and end of the street) is insufficient.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you in advance.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kilburn Place, Kilburn, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8323652&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Road sinking, 21st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8323620</link>
<description>Road has sunk down quite a lot over the year, has been reported before and &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot;. Any cars coming down the road towards Queensway at speed and unaware are bottoming out on the raised manhole cover. I believe this is becoming dangerous as cars may swerve to avoid and could cause problems for scooters or motorbikes.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Woodhurst Avenue, Petts Wood, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8323620&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
