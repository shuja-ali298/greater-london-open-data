<title>Dead fox in bushes off path in the cemetery, 2nd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795949</link>
<description>There has been a dead fox in the bushes off one of the paths near the fields at the back of the cemetery for around a month now. I’ve reported it previously but appreciate it may be difficult to find. There are the three paths leading up from the cemetery into the fields, and the fox is in the bushes/under a tree at the end of the first path coming from the southwest end of the cemetery&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7795949.0.jpeg?03868121&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 45, Ryedale, Nunhead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795949&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Kerbstone near Gloucester Road, Cromwell Road junction (southwest side), 2nd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795920</link>
<description>A kerbstone is out of place and as a result is sticking up significantly (several inches) and is dangerous because it is a trip hazard. I did not see this and very nearly tripped on it, which would have sent me face down onto the road with a high danger of being run over.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7795920.0.jpeg?9f0047b4&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gloucester Road, South Kensington, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795920&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Animal fat/grease outside Rio&#39;s Piri Piri, 2nd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795881</link>
<description>Animal fat/grease outside Rio&amp;#39;s Piri Piri. This is a persistent problem. Surely a health hazard and dangerous health and safety issue? The fat is congealed on surface and embedded in space between slabs. I see this was reported over a year ago. Has it ever been cleaned? Or is more fat poured on the pavement regularly?&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 114, Lisson Grove, St. John&#39;s Wood, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795881&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Construction rubbish has been abandoned for days in front of Shere House, 2nd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795874</link>
<description>Shere House, within the block of flats numbered 24–31,someone has been leaving a large amount of construction waste in front of the building. More rubbish is being added each day, and the area has been in this state for several days with no one coming to collect or clean it up. A report had already been opened and was under investigation. However, it was closed without a resolution, and the trash is still there. Another report had been opened due to construction debris nearby — that one was resolved, but for unknown reasons, both reports were marked as duplicates. However, that is not the case. The construction debris remains in front of Shere House and is now even posing a danger to pedestrians, as nails are exposed in some of the discarded materials.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7795874.0.jpeg?da81a165&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Trinity Street, The Borough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795874&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Private construction is banning the whole pavement access using bars, 2nd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795745</link>
<description>Private construction is banning the whole pavement access using bars (section of Warwick Ave near to Warrington Gardens) so we cannot go through their portion of construction. So anyone walking on West side of the Warwick Ave needs to detour. This makes pedestrians having to go on the road where there are parked cars which is really dangerous because incoming cars cannot see pedestrians going into the road. This is also a construction that is not public work and they did not build any temporary pedestrian walkways. I couldn’t take photos because workers were staring at me and didn’t want them to be upset with me.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 45, Warwick Avenue, Maida Vale, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7795745&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
