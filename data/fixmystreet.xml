<title>Cut down tree growing through tarmac, 19th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8048733</link>
<description>A tree has not been cut down properly and is now growing through the tarmac. The replacement of the nice looking tiles seem to not be a thing anymore, and we are given awful looking miss-matched tarmac now. This has meant that the trees are re-growing through the cheap tarmac. It would be lovely if this cloud be done properly and the like for like tiles were laid to prevent a job having to be don’t multiple times.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): King&#39;s Grove, Peckham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8048733&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Church Path is massively overgrown and is also in need of lighting...., 19th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8048677</link>
<description>Noone has cut back the foliage in Church Path which means it is overgrown with brambles and unpleasant to walk along. It also sorely needs lighting as it is dangerous to walk at night as you can&amp;#39;t see the foliage and there are many hidden spaces.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 11, Theobald&#39;s Avenue, North Finchley, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8048677&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Neither of the traffic lights appear particularly visible to vehicles turning left from Evelyn Street into Oxestalls Road. I witnessed two vehicles driving through red lights last week when cyclists had green lights so appears to be a recent problem as not witnessed before.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8048652.0.jpeg?b42b1adb&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Oxestalls Road, Deptford, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8048652&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Persistent Littering by Thomas Tallis School Students, 19th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8048647</link>
<description>Hi there,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to express my deep concern about the continuing and escalating problem of littering by students from Thomas Tallis School on Kidbrooke Park Road (SE3 9PX). The litter is accumulating daily—not only on the streets around the school—but also along Kidbrook Way, Rochester Way, and even directly in my own driveway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Every day, food wrappers, half-empty beverage containers, takeaway boxes, and general waste are being discarded across the local area. Some of this rubbish ends up in bushes, on pavements, and in residential driveways, creating an environment that is unsightly, unhygienic, and frankly unacceptable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not a one-off issue. Reports on the FixMyStreet portal confirm that this problem is widespread and persistent in the area:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- One report notes that “absolutely everyday [outside Thomas Tallis School] covered with litter, especially takeaway boxes the children throw on the ground rather than a bin.” Despite these reports, the issue continues to recur.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;- Another report describes how rats, mice, and foxes are scavenging through chicken boxes and other rubbish dumped near the school, underscoring the public health risks at play.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I urge the Council to take immediate and robust action. Please consider implementing the following:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;1. Increased street cleaning frequency—especially during and immediately after school hours—to prevent rubbish from mounting up. 2. Installation of additional bins at strategic locations on Kidbrooke Park Road, Kidbrook Way, and Rochester Way to provide convenient disposal points. 3. Targeted enforcement of anti-littering laws, including issuing fines to those seen littering near the school. 4. Coordination with Thomas Tallis School - working with school leadership to introduce anti-littering education, student litter patrols, and clean-up initiatives. 5. Engagement with local businesses, particularly food outlets, to encourage them to install bins and participate in shared efforts to keep the area clean.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents, businesses, and visitors should not have to endure daily encounters with unacceptable levels of waste. The current state of the streets is diminishing the quality of life in the area and risks serious public health and environmental harm.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I request a prompt update on the steps the Council plans to take to remedy this situation. If the issue remains unaddressed, I will consider escalating this to local ward councillors or public forums.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your attention to this matter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kidbrooke Way, Kidbrooke, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8048647&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerous playground equipment and flooring, 19th August</title>

<description>Playground equipment has been broken for weeks. Swing is broken/missing, as is the zip line. Other equipment is in a state of disrepair and the flooring is hazardous, with the surface coming away and gaps in many places.
