<title>Light not working, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8862975</link>
<description>You came and installed a new lamp post at the end of my driveway with no prior warning, leaving us now with 2 lamp posts, neither of them work. The new post is even closer to the property causing it to be more difficult to enter and exit the driveway, especially in the dark as the road is already narrow and we have cars that park directly opposite that cause obstruction as the area is used when there are no bays available.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Silver Spring Close, Northumberland Heath, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8862975&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Absolute pit, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8862897</link>
<description>Hill View Drive and pretty much all the roads round it are full of decaying litter and general filth in the kerbsides and gutters. I used to litterpick the while area but havent been able to and cant help but notice that it hardly ever gets done. I appreciate parked cars make it difficult but tbh there were hardly any cars in Hill View Drive today. It looks utterly filthy. Theres also a bus stop at junction of Hill View Drive and Miles Drive which is an absolute sea of rubbish. Ive seen rats in Hill View Drive on numerous occasions because the litter contains discarded food. IT ALL NEEDS CLEARING. The wet weather makes it worse. Its now like a food/litter/filth/leaves paste that washes down gutters and blocks them&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Belmarsh Road, Thamesmead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8862897&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
