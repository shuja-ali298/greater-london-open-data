<title>Manhole clanking again, 8th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869442</link>
<description>This manhole cover was fixed on April 14th 2025. It has started clanking again. I reported it on 29th December 2025 to email : Highways@southwark.gov.uk. This was who had fixed it in April 2025. They emailed me advising me that the road is maintained by TFL, and copied londonstreets@tfl.gov.uk into the reply. I have emailed three times and not had a reply. I have now resorted to this website. Please can you tell me who maintains this road and if the manhole can be fixed. There is also a second manhole clanking outside The Pommelers Rest Pub on Tower Bridge Road. Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8869442.0.jpeg?155b92a6&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tooley Street, Bermondsey, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869442&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Offensive vandalism in tunnel under Wells Way, 8th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869393</link>
<description>In the tunnel connecting the two sides of Burgess Park (under wells way road), someone has put up very disturbing wooden plaques of knives, machetes and axes? They have also written gang slang on the wooden boats hung up by the park. It’s is really very disturbing as many of us commute past these images daily on our way to work. I love burgess park and it upsets me that this has happened and has been up for several weeks now, but nothing is being done about it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8869393.0.jpeg?dd03d846&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 55, Wells Way, Walworth, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869393&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Cycle lane traffic island has no illumination or warning bollards, 8th February</title>

<description>It&amp;#39;s happened again! The second time this weekend and the fifth time that we are of. Photos show damage to the underside of this car - it&amp;#39;s undriveable with bodywork jammed on the near side front wheel and the airbag inflated. This is outside 122/124 College Road, SE19 1XD. Please sort this island out before more cars are damaged! We don&amp;#39;t even no why the island is there. It is a hazard to motoring.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8869282.0.jpeg?a39b596b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): College Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869282&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Two big potholes next to each other getting bigger, 8th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869267</link>
<description>I think that this is a pothole that was &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; a week ago but has now opened up at both ends of the new tarmac. This is as to come onto Radbourne Road from Weir Road. The rest of Radbourne Road has smaller potholes (although dangerous for cyclists) and the road looks as if it is breaking up in many places.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8869267.0.jpeg?fa1000f7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Radbourne Road, Streatham Hill, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869267&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Several cracked pavement slabs outside 29 Bedwell house residential flats SW9 6AG Brixton road., 8th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869220</link>
<description>I like to report several cracked pavement slabs outside number 29 Bedwell house residential flats on Brixton Road SW9. The cracked slabs have raised ends which could possibly prove fatal if someone has a mis-step over them. Please could they be repaired at your earliest convenience. It seems a heavy truck or dustbin lorry may have drove onto it thus causing the substantial damage. The pavements has been like this for over two months.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8869220.0.jpeg?6d6f2dea&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): George Mews, Brixton, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8869220&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
