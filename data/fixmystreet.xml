<title>Abandoned blue bin, 19th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8438440</link>
<description>It’s been here for a few weeks. In our little road we’ve all got our own bins so it’s not ours. It’s full of rubbish and blocking the pavement. I’m afraid someone will tip it over.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8438440.0.jpeg?b1d109c1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Buckstone Close, Nunhead, London Borough of Southwark&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8438440&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Litterbin still not emptied litter still on the verge, 19th November</title>

<description>A couple of days ago I reported this problem which had already lasted several days. Yesterday you told me the problem had been &amp;quot;fixed&amp;quot; because appropriate action had been taken (see screenshot attached). This morning I found that what you told me was inaccurate. The litter bin has still not been emptied and there is is still litter on the verge (see photo attached). Please now empty the bin and pick up the litter. Please let me know when this has been done.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8438271.0.jpeg?62fd985c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 39, Stone Park Avenue, Eden Park, Bromley, London Borough of Bromley&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8438271&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Constant Road works now both sides of the road, 19th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8438267</link>
<description>We have had roadworks in Sevenoaks Way since Feb 2025, this has now moved to Sandy Lane which now cuts off another route that can be taken to avoid Crittall corners roundabout, they have been their for weeks and it is still shut, the roundabout is now gridlocked everyday, there are now roadworks outside Sports Direct going the other way, which means it is now Gridlocked going both ways, my 20 minute journey to work now takes me over an hour and most of that is sitting in the road I live in (Sevenoaks Way) How much longer is this going to go on for, it makes no sense to gridlock both sides of the road which is access to a roundabout that is access to major motorways? I am afraid it is becoming difficult to even leave the house.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I look forward to hearing from you.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Mrs Claire Still&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 44, Sevenoaks Way, St Paul&#39;s Cray, Orpington, London Borough of Bromley&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8438267&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
