<title>Dear local aerial manager could you please address this issue last year summer 2023. where a resident who lives daintry way E9 5JJ has been going around the Daintry way courtyard with a jet washer washing all the paving stones with a high pressure rised jet washer which has made all paving stones come loose because all the sand and grout has been jet washed at high pressure causing it to come loose and wobbly. The local aerial manager Denise Corbin is aware and she even praised resident on a good job making the area nice But she doesn&#39;t realise the damage the resident has caused by making all the paving stones loose now.Hackney council would have to pay to get paving stone relayed reset fixed. Causing problems for elderly residence who cannot walk properly. by stumping their feet on the paving stones and tripping over then have to call for a local ambulance to help the resident in distress up. putting the strain on the ambulance service. Dear Denise Corbin please get your act together. May need further training in her career to benefit residents. Hackney Council passing the buck and not wanting to do their job or pay for the work to be done as usual negligence., 30th October</title>

<description>I observed this for a few weeks now. At the beginning of Station Crescent, right in front of the Royal Mail Postbox (Westcombe hill side) there are a few potholes in the street asphalt and a sort of coloured water is surfacing. There doesn&amp;#39;t appear to be any smell. I contacted Thames Water and, after inspection, they told me it&amp;#39;s not their problem and to contact the council.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8355094.0.jpeg?e810c96f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Station Crescent, East Greenwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8355094&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
