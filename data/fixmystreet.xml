<title>Flytiiping Electrical fridge freezer abandoned in the car park of whitgift House SE11 6AG, 10th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7689056</link>
<description>Somebody has discarded and fly tipped a fridge freezer in the car park of Whitgift house SE11 6AG. It has been here for over two weeks and no action has been taken by Lambeth Council. Lambeth Council removed this discarded fridge today, urgently and without any more delay, before someone hurts themselves. Failure to remove immediately will force us to logg an official complaint and escalate matters.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7689056.0.jpeg?251e46dd&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Whitgift Street, Lambeth, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7689056&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Cycle barrier stops cycle tourists and trailers, 10th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7689046</link>
<description>This cycle barrier should be removed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many cycle tourists use this route, which is part of NCN1, either to come from the Continent to tour England or going from London to the Continent. They are heavily-laden with panniers and other luggage, which they have to remove in order to get their bikes through the barrier.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This barrier may have been installed to prevent motorbikes accessing the path, but they come over the adjacent fields and bypass the barrier.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am a volunteer helping to manage the vegetation along the path, so I have a trailer behind my bike carrying all our tools. I have to disconnect the trailer and it is not easy to man-handle it through the barrier.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7689046.0.jpeg?6a0d9fa0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Cray Riverway + London Loop, Barnes Cray, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7689046&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large tree branch half hanging off tree, 10th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7689032</link>
<description>A large tree on the estate has a half broken branch with a lot of weight to it hanging from the tree. The branch has snapped but not fully. I am concerned for if and when the tree would snap completely that this could hit a member of the public, especially any young children in the area as they like to play out the front.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Not only that, the tree is very close to where cars are parked and if it was to fall a certain way, it has the potential of causing severe damage to parked cars. Please can this be sorted ASAP.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 3, Petersham Gardens, St Paul&#39;s Cray, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7689032&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
