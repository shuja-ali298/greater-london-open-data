<title>Dear local Trowbridge Residence and leaseholders please be advised and beware of organised gang criminal group that are stealing motor vehicles on a daily basis at this location and operating from Beanacre Cl, London E9 5JY,Merriam Ave, London E9 5LS has been reported to the local Hackney council anti-social behavior department and the metropolitan police service which seem to be lazy to act or do anything about this anti-social behavior and criminal activity. Criminal gang have recently stolen a white Toyota from Brentwood, also stole a gray Audi from Richmond Kew gardens, they have nicked cars from Ilford and Romford, stealing car Kent, they are stealing all different types of cars but they seem to have a thing for Toyota&#39;s Criminals are stealing motor vehicles and robbery on a daily basis in all different boroughs. once they have stolen the vehicle. they then drive the stolen car back to the location at Beanacre Cl, London E9 5JY,Merriam Ave, London E9 5LS to strip the vehicle down and change the identity of the stolen car i.e clone plates switch to avoid police capture an ampr cameras, throwing number plates down Hackney council manhole cover drainage system,removing GPS trackers, previous owners property and possessions are then discarded in and around public footpath on the floor,on roofs,in gardens, down drain covers, criminal gang discard anything that can link them to the robbery or crime by discarding evidence. Criminal activity takes place all hours,early hours daytime,morning.Organise gang also using mopeds to do the robberies and cars. The gang are wearing dark clothing tracksuits with face masks and gloves. The gang possibly are Irish travellers. By the sounds of it the local council do not care about stolen vehicles and anti-social behavior also the metropolitan police show an incompetence attitude towards the reports that are being made in regards to stolen vehicles and robbery allowing this to happen. Residence and leaseholders have to remember at the end of the day Hackney council and the police get a wage and they go home they don&#39;t care. Safer neighbourhood police have allowed this to go on for many years.SNT Not using their initiative and being lazy to investigate. Hackney council and the metropolitan police safe and neighborhood team need to work alongside with Hackney council to come up with a strategic plan to tackle these issues. Assigning a DS officer to investigate.who has experienced in organised crime not like snt and surveillance operations., 25th August</title>

<title>There was a group of counsellors, Cllr Jessica Webb, volunteer Ellie,Cllr Christopher Kennedy, was seen on 03/08/25 at 14:37pm in Merriam Ave, garages E9 5NE observing looking at a member of public,residence private paperwork, property items laying on the floor discarded from a vehicle theft or robbery which has been discarded inbetween the garages out of sight of the metropolitan police commissioners camera. The councillors did not take any action or report this. Councillors turn a blind eye but they were not to know it was connected with a robbery. Councillors just looked at it like someone&#39;s dumped their rubbish which is not the case. This is a victim of crimes property. This behaviour has been witnessed time and time and again authority and safer neighbourhood police do nothing. This has been repeatedly going on for a number of years criminal activity what is the councillors doing about this you have seen with your own eyes now what action are you taking. You want people to vote for you but you do not serve the community in this anti-social behaviour and criminal activity which you have witnessed and seen the evidence. This is not the first time there is multiple victims over the last couple of years property being discarded out of stolen vehicles. Where is a large group of residents involved in criminal activity who live on the Trowbridge estates. I do not have much hope in the councillors or authority because they do nothing.They are lazy and competent people and do not deserve to serve the community. leave residents,tenants to suffer this anti-social behavior.The evidence and facts are laying in front of you. Do your jobs and your duties you signed up for and serve your community., 25th August</title>

<title>Dear Simon Priscilla and Denise Corbin housing managers of Hackney wick could you please address this issue.Osborne road antisocial behaviour lime bike.You have decided or have struct a deal with the Lime bike company allocating 3 car parking spaces in Osborne road which is an absolute nightmare for the residents. How can you justify this decision taking up car space for Lime bikes that pay no insurance, no road tax, and not paying for car parking permit like I am, why are privileged. This is also causing ASB especially at the weekend. Why have Hackney council given Lime preferential treatment I am sick of moving these bikes out of my way because of the outrages decision you&#39;ve made. I have been a resident in Osborne road for 25 years and never experience such disruption. I have always owned a car and I have always paid from 2012 for a parking permit yet the nuisance bike get everything for free. I have asked in the pass to have a designated parking space with a very valid reason and guess what you refused but, now you give LIME BIKES FREE Parking which is causing a nuisance. Whoever, thought this was a good idea perhaps you should have this going on outside your own home and see how you like it. Lastly they are also leaving bikes near peoples cars I came out one day to find a bike learning on peoples cars. I THINK YOU SHOULD REMOVE THIS IDEA IMMEDIATELY. Other boroughs are scrapping them completed because of the nuisance these bikes are causing is seen on TV las week. Good morning Britain. I will be showing pictures of these bikes on Good Morning Britian and explaing to them what an issue it is causing in this cul-da-sac . The users leave the bikes anywhere they feel like it, I have had to personally move bikes in order to get passed when driving my car and when walking out of my front door. Friday and Saturday nights are worse than a week day. Is there a deal thats been made with the company to allow this prefe., 25th August</title>

<title>A resident keeps throwing his dog waste in the public recycling,general waste bin next to the bus stop on Osborne Road next to my back garden gate at 12 Inglesham Walk, London E9 5JS which in summer this causes a stench and a horrid smell of dog feces.if someone could please address this behavior. Hackney Council should put designated dog waste bins for this purpose not near someone&#39;s back garden fence. No, a resident cannot legally throw dog mess into a public bin located next to your garden gate in Hackney; this is considered a criminal offense of fly-tipping, as the bins are for public use and not private property for disposing of their dog&#39;s waste. If you wish to report this issue, you should contact Hackney Council or the police, as officers can issue a Fixed Penalty Notice or prosecute for the offense., 25th August</title>

<title>Overflowing branches and overgrown weeds on Portland Street, 25th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8071822</link>
<description>The tree branches and what appears to be weeds along Portland Street are getting quite long and low and need pruning. Also the tree is overflowing onto the pavement making it difficult for people with disabilities or individuals with prams or buggies.
