<title>Big potholes along Coldharbour Lane, 16th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8933256</link>
<description>Coldharbour Lane between Cambria Road and Atlantic Road is riddled with potholes, which are increasing in number and depth, many are 3 inches deep. About 15 new potholes have appeared in the past 2 months. There is one particularly dangerous area at the northeast corner of Coldharbour Lane and Hinton Road where a drain cover in the carriageway has seen all the paving around the cover erode, so effectively there&amp;#39;s a 3-inch deep, 5-inch wide &amp;quot;moat&amp;quot; around the drain cover. This is really dangerous to cyclists because it forces us to swerve into the line of oncoming traffic, as the carriageway at this location is narrow with not enough room to avoid the drain cover while staying out of the way of traffic.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 296, Coldharbour Lane, Loughborough Junction, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8933256&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large holes in verges, 16th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8933116</link>
<description>The remedial works undertaken following the gas main works in Lincoln Road last year have failed. In the verges throughout the road there are deep holes where vehicles have driven along the verges. These present a trip hazard, especially in the dark. These photos show the holes outside 13, 20 and 24 Lincoln Road but there are holes present all through the road. I am aware that the road is being resurfaced shortly. Given the safety aspects of these holes. Perhaps they could be remedied at the same time?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8933116.0.jpeg?8a0217bb&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lincoln Road, North End, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8933116&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
