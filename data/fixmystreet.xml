<title>Overhanging Trees- Safety Concern for Property and Public Path, 17th August</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8036084</link>
<description>Dear Bromley Council, I am writing to raise a concern regarding two large trees affecting both our property at 137 Lockesley Drive and the adjoining public path. One of the trees is situated in our neighbourâ€™s garden 135 Lockesley Drive. She is an elderly lady, and we are concerned that she may not be in a position to arrange or fund the necessary work herself. The branches from this tree are significantly overhanging into our garden and onto the public path.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The second tree is located just outside her garden, close by, and is also contributing to the problem.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Together, these trees are causing the following issues:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Obstructing the public path and creating a hazard for pedestrians.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Overhanging into our garden, blocking natural light.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Ongoing maintenance problems due to falling leaves, sap, and debris.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Risk of damage to property and danger to both residents and the public if large branches fall in high winds or storms. Given the safety implications for both private residents and members of the public, as well as the difficulty our elderly neighbour may face in addressing this problem independently, I kindly request that the council arrange for the trees to be inspected and pruned back as soon as possible. Please advise on the next steps and the timeframe for this matter to be resolved.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your prompt attention.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Your sincerely Victor Dragan 137Lockesley Drive BR5 2AD Mob.nr. 07474163857&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lockesley Drive, Poverest, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8036084&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
