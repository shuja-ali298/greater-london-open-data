<title>Tesco social responsibility towards litter, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8816708</link>
<description>Tesco is not showing any social responsibility towards the road they make so much profit on. Their products end up in the immediate waste bins. They refuse to clean the area directly in front of their shop. It is not acceptable to push the problem to the locals who already litter pick or to the council to increase collections when funds are limited . We would like Tesco to show some responsibility towards the road. Their business is a fantastic success and has increased traffic on the local roads, partly causing demand for a new roundabout which has caused increased traffic congestion and pollution. Please may we respectfully ask that Tesco takes some responsibility by tidying up the excess litter created by their business.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8816708.0.jpeg?617012df&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 133, South Eden Park Road, Beckenham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8816708&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>With restriction outside Acland burghley school, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8816627</link>
<description>On 1/2/26 at 7pm I was driving through the width restriction on Burghley road outside acland burghley school when my vehicle was damaged. The width restriction is extremely narrow and difficult to navigate safely, even at very low speed I was driving, in addition to that the weather was raining heavily which also cause my car to slip. There is limited visibility and insufficient clearance for standard-sized vehicles, and the kerbs/barriers are positioned in a way that leaves no margin for error. As a result, my car (Mazda mx30 reg: WA21 LFL) made contact with the side of the restriction, causing visible damage to the front left wing and bumper. I believe the layout and design of this width restriction make it unsafe for regular vehicles and that it directly caused the damage to my car. I have attached photos of the damage, the restriction itself. I am seeking reimbursement for the repair costs as the damage occurred due to an unsafe and poorly designed road feature maintained by the council. This isn’t the first time that this width restriction has scratched my car and damaged a lot of others cars.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Burghley Road, Tufnell Park, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8816627&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dropped pavement for pathway on Brill pl, 1st February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8816597</link>
<description>The dropped pathway leading to the pathway has recently ( in last few months ) been rebuilt but it&amp;#39;s not level with the road? There is a lip of an inch or 2 at the junction of the road and pavement which means crossing the road from Francis Cricks institute to the pathway on my mobility scooter isn&amp;#39;t possible as it&amp;#39;s not level and dangerous. I have no idea if the rebuild was done by Camden or others. I complained about this on 19th Jan COMLR26188 but haven&amp;#39;t had a response.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Brill Place, Somers Town, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8816597&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
