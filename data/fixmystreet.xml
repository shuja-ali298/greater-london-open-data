<title>Large storage box in communal garden, 13th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7870158</link>
<description>In the communal garden where I live there is a large storage box which needs removing. I do not know how it came to be in the garden left up against a wall but it has been there for some time. There is also some other litter scattered about in the garden but I cannot see what it/ they may be. Can this storage box and other litter be cleared. Thank you On a separate note I have sent a request regarding one of the shed doors behind the first block in Strongbow Road. There was a typing error on this request and it should have stated shed door. Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Strongbow Crescent, Well Hall, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7870158&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>More Rubbish ….!!!, 13th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7870117</link>
<description>They’ve been out again overnight and dumped all of their filth in the park. This is a health hazard. Soiled nappies and running alive with flies. I have no complaints about Peabody clearing these issues once reported and I appreciate the extent of the problem in the area but when will Peabody tackle this constant problem? Look at the number of reports for this particular spot, surely something could be done to catch these people. Does anyone look through this rubbish for any evidence?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7870117.0.jpeg?0dbbdc8f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Campion Place, Thamesmead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7870117&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Rabbit/Animal holes, 13th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7870089</link>
<description>Over by the right hand start of the obstacle course, there are at least 3 big holes in the ground. Children are running around and over these holes everyday. And it could cause a child to fall or potentially break a bone if their leg got wedged.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Close by there is also what appears to be a left over metal buckle and screw sticking up out of the ground from previous playground furniture which is stuck. A child could really hurt themselves if they they fell in the screw/bolt.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Southwood Road, New Eltham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7870089&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
