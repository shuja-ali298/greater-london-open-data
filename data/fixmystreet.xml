<title>Police investigation needed, 19th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8441599</link>
<description>The discriminatory practices applied to street cleaning by Enfield council and the fraudulent claims need police investigation and must reflect greater ills. They have published a rota claiming church hill is cleaned once a week on a Wednesday. This is an actual lie. It is not. When the local Conservative councillors urge them to the council empty the bin on church hill and collect some leaves around it to make the bags appear full. The entire stretch of church hill is left filthy. The church itself is suffering an increase of litter which the council never remove. The church area on Compton road is also filthy and cleaned by a volunteer with learning needs. The mosque on Green lanes is regularly cleaned. It is really very concerning. More concerning are the lies that church hill is cleaned at all, let alone once a week. All other council practices including housing, and other areas of governance must be investigated as a matter of public urgency.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8441599.0.jpeg?0d1ff89f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Stone Hall Road, Southgate, Enfield, London Borough of Enfield&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8441599&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Complete disgust for a place for children/adults and sports lovers to enjoy, 19th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8441534</link>
<description>This so called outdoor sports pen/court was an idea in the making when I was a child. (I am not a 44yr old Nan)… It did not come to fruition until my own children were in their early teens (One of whom actually took up basketball and secured a $545,000 scholarship in 2 colleges in the USA when she turned 18 that allowed her to get a degree and a masters degree through basketball). So to now see this area become such an horrendous site is very sad. I often take my 3yr old Grandson her, and see many other young children use this area and it has bushes/glass/broken fences/unchanged bins/rubbish/leaves and an endless list of crap just piled high for weeks and months on end. It is very sad. It would be very nice that this area is kept clean and tidy by whoever is actually paid by Lewisham to do so. As if not bad enough that the local social housing young people get a bad name for “hanging” around on streets, or playing in roads where acts are when this is what they have and it cannot be kept clean. You can see the bin has been used to the fullest. Why do councils put these purpose built sports facilities in communities and then just leave them to rot like you do your tenants. Absolutely unacceptable. I am actually really enjoying this online app to report stuff. It’s not the first time, just a shame the people who work for the council do not actually leave their office and stroll their “area” and see how their paid staff seem to be getting paid but not actually doing the work. Beggars belief you want to put a high rise tower block and name it Bermondsey Heights in a postcode area of SE15/SE14 and sell it off like it’s The Shard when local people cannot even get their Local Authority to clean a children play area or cut back a few bushes. I think it is about time you actually when and checked properly on any type of outdoor facilities like this/kids play areas etc and see how damaged they are. Pretty sure most could do with a simple jet wash and abit of paint. I am disgusted this Pen/Court area is like this. Please sort it and make sure that it’s on someone calendar to come and check again…. And yes I am aware leave can be a problem. But they are also a serious health hazard too.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8441534.0.jpeg?735fa465&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hornshay Street, New Cross Gate, London Borough of Lewisham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8441534&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
