<title>Floor carpeted with litter and glass outside primary school, 24th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8459508</link>
<description>The gutters, pavements and roads outside st Patrick’s primary school, Ancona road, are literally covered in litter. There are broken glass bottles of alcohol, empty beer cans and general litter all over the street and this has been slowly gathering for weeks despite it being reported. Please can a team come out to deal with this? The bulk of the glass is right outside the nursery where 3 and 4 year olds run around the school gates, it’s not safe.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8459508.0.jpeg?08f738b5&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Griffin Road, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8459508&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Abandoned Recycling Bin, 24th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8459411</link>
<description>Hi,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am hoping you are able to forward this to someone who can deal with this request.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On Sunday 2nd November I noticed a recycling bin left near a request bus stop in Frances Street just up the road from Belson Road. By the afternoon of Tuesday 4th November the recycling bin had been walked passed by a few hundred people taking their children to Cardwell school. Late afternoon I had a walk passed the bin and noticed it is marked “23”. I had a walk round and could not find a home address of 23.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;When I got home I had a look on Google Maps in Street View. I found a local address for 23 in Lord Warwick Street. I waited until early evening when the occupant of number 23 had arrived home. I went out and rang their door bell. When the person opened the door I asked if they were missing a recycling bin but they said no. (I have added a copy of number 23 from Google Maps Street View below.)&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Image0.png&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I went out later Tuesday evening and when I returned home it looked like the recycling bin had been taken away. Then when I went out Thursday evening I noticed the recycling bin has only been moved to next to the bus shelter in Frances Street near the Belson Road junction.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Could you please arrange for this recycling bin to be removed and reused by someone else who may need it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you. Mr D Martin.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Frances Street, Woolwich&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8459411&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
