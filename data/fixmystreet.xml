<title>Constant litter and filth, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667790</link>
<description>Once again the streets off Chatterton road, namely Walpole, Bloomfield and Cowper are loaded with litter both blown down from Chatterton and cast off by lazy locals - the biggest problem is we never see street cleaners in these roads?? Only Chatterton - really not nice. This morning there were several used nappies and lots of litter just scattered around on Walpole, pretty disgusting - PLEASE can we have these off roads swept / cleaned at least once a week? Chatteton is done daily. It&amp;#39;s not nice to live amongst this recurring filth&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8667790.0.jpeg?cbf21104&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Walpole Road, Southborough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667790&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Broken wire fence supports, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667621</link>
<description>The fence between the end of church road and the graveyard is damaged. I first reported this last in January last year ref 6943128 and was told it had been fixed. The metal uprights which support the wire fence weren&amp;#39;t repaired and now more have worked loose/broken leaving the fence in a dangerous state. If it falls towards the graveyard it could do damage, and the other way could damage vehicles. Also it would leave the graveyard and our premises unsecured.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8667621.0.jpeg?7b3cab2f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Upland Road, Blendon, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667621&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Incomplete clearance of overgrown vegetation still obstructing pavement and roadway, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667605</link>
<description>I am writing to formally appeal the handling of this issue, as the recent works carried out did not fully address the problem originally reported.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;While some cutting appears to have taken place, other overgrown vegetation remains and continues to significantly impede both the pavement and the edge of the roadway. As a result, pedestrians are still being forced into the road to pass. This is creating severe difficulty and genuine safety concerns, particularly when walking with children, pushchairs, or for anyone with reduced mobility.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In practical terms, navigating this stretch feels unsafe and unpredictable, with branches and vegetation obstructing the path at head and body height. It is not an exaggeration to say that pedestrians are being ambushed by overgrowth when trying to pass through, which defeats the purpose of the initial intervention.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This issue was previously reported under reference number 8482318, which clearly outlined the safety risks and the need for urgent, comprehensive trimming to restore safe public access. Unfortunately, the current state suggests that the work was incomplete and the hazard remains.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I respectfully request that this location is re-inspected as a priority and that all remaining overgrown vegetation obstructing the pavement and roadway is properly cut back to ensure the route is fully and safely passable.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Heathside Avenue, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667605&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>URGENT - Street light not working Selborne Road, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667581</link>
<description>URGENT - Street light in Selborne Road not working. This has been reported under FixMyStreet ref: 8586818 and FixMyStreet ref: 8637265. This is now my 3rd report! Despite providing all the relevant information to the lighting department by email at their request on the non working street lamp in Selborne Road, I received notifications that it has been fixed. I further add these notifications were not related to my report reference FixMyStreet ref: 8586818 and 8637265. THIS HAS NOT BEEN FIXED!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The street lamp has been photographed and send to you three times!!! Normally the street lamps have a number on the front; I have taken a note of the number at the back of the one that is not working: GB13/89351. Please could you have this fixed ASAP as the area is very dark without lighting. Thank you!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8667581.0.jpeg?f462ca23&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Selborne Road, Camberwell, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8667581&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
