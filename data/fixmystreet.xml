<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340983</link>
<description>This rubbish has now been sitting there for nearly for fortnight and nothing has been done about it either via the street cleaners or otherwise. I live at St Lukes Court, 124-126 Tooley Street and have walked passed this daily.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8340983.0.jpeg?36e69f7f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 128, Tooley Street, The Borough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340983&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bollard missing, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340963</link>
<description>The bollard at Croydon road has been missing for over a month.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We have observed that cars are traveling very fast at night. This is creating a significant safety hazard and, if not addressed quickly, will likely lead to another accident soon.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8340963.0.jpeg?a695a662&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 319, Croydon Road, Elmers End, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340963&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Neighbour at 219 is dumping their rubbish outside, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340949</link>
<description>The neighbour at 219 leaves their rubbish left on the pavement. (I can confirm it is them as their address shows on some of the rubbish) The loose rubbish has taken over the pavement at times, flown into the road, will attract pests and creates an unpleasant appearance for the whole street. For the sake of a clean and pleasant environment, please contact them about placing their rubbish inside the designated wheelie bin(s).&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8340949.0.jpeg?f1e1b321&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 217, Ilderton Road, Bermondsey, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340949&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Kemble House - Rubbish &amp; Recycling, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340899</link>
<description>The Rubbish and Recycling systems need to be improved. Some of the general waste bins are without lids which often leads to bin bags being placed on the floor or on top of the bins. More waste and recycling bins are needed, and they need to have lids to stop the rats and mice getting in. There should be a proper bin store here too so it looks better.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Barrington Road, Loughborough Junction, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340899&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Outside of 219 Kilburn lane, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340822</link>
<description>There is rubbish constantly on Kilburn lane, every single day. Every day I walk outside my door there is someone’s bin contents on my door step. The council tax is one of the highest in London and due to this we expect our streets to be clean. I have attached pictures of today’s mess on the street, but it is like this every single day. Please please can something be done about this? I believe it is because some houses do not have wheely bins so they have to put their bin bags on the street and foxes get into them, then the wind blows the rubbish everywhere. This has been an issue since I moved here last December&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8340822.0.jpeg?59f4022c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Kilburn Lane, North Kensington, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340822&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fox - health risk, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340809</link>
<description>A fox consistently manages to get into the basement of Berkeley Court. There are children that have access to the basement. The fox might bite someone if it feels threatened in a confined space risking giving rabies. Foxes also spread disease. Its climbing all over the vehicles in the basement and has been leaving its pee and other waste all over the cars and everywhere in the basement. This can be a health risk for the residents. In addition, there is further risk of eating cables under the vehicle that can have life risking consequences. Ive asked the building management to do something about this but over a year later they have done nothing and now the fox is more at ease to keep returning.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8340809.0.jpeg?b0b9e766&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Glentworth Street, Marylebone, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8340809&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
