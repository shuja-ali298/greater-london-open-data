<title>Dog fouling on park terrace tudway road, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8238579</link>
<description>I am writing to raise serious concerns about the ongoing problem of dog fouling in Kidbrooke. This has been an issue for well over a year now, and it continues to have a negative impact on the community.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many dog walkers in the area are acting carelessly, allowing their dogs to foul on pavements, streets, and green spaces without cleaning up after them. Unfortunately, some appear to have no regard for the health, safety, and wellbeing of other residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This behaviour is not only unpleasant but also poses genuine health risks, especially to children who play outside. It makes our streets and walkways unhygienic, damages the reputation of our neighbourhood, and creates an environment where people feel disregarded by those who are unwilling to act responsibly.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents have waited a long time for this issue to be addressed. We urgently ask the council to take stronger action, such as increased signage, patrols, fines, or community awareness campaigns, to ensure that those who neglect their responsibilities are held accountable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We would greatly appreciate your support in tackling this matter, so Kidbrooke can once again be a clean, safe, and welcoming place for everyone.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8238579.0.jpeg?7339a912&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Park Terrace, Kidbrooke, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8238579&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
