<description>Bin&amp;#39;s for 139a always on pavement and rubbish overflowing constantly, pavement should be clear for public access and especially wheelchair users, I&amp;#39;d like the bins removed and a warning to be issued to residents.

<title>Missing light on public footpath and staircase, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8236164</link>
<description>We moved to Hill Crescent earlier in the year and are dependent on the trains from Bexley station for our commutes to and from work. There are two footpaths leading to Hill Crescent but none of them are lid at all. This report in particular, is addressing the footpath and staircase between Hill Crescent and Vicarage Road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The reduced daylight in the autumn and winter months combined with the steepness of the path make it rather unsafe to walk on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Discussing potential reasons for the absence of lighting with other residents on Hill Crescent it was mentioned that some residents may have been bothered by light coming into their property or the presence of bats. The presence of high fences between the path and properties should avoid any light pollution by installing lower lights. The issue of bats was addressed in other councils without putting the public at risk of falling, e.g.: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-49534621.amp&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for looking into this.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hill Crescent, Coldblow, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8236164&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Missing Street Lighting on Public Path, 1st October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8236151</link>
<description>We moved to Hill Crescent earlier in the year and are dependent on the trains from Bexley station for our commutes to and from work. There are two footpaths leading to Hill Crescent but none of them are lid at all. This report in particular, is addressing the footpath between Hill Crescent, alongside Becketts Close and the main path leading to St. Mary’s Church Hall.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The reduced daylight in the autumn and winter months combined with the unevenness and steepness of the path make it rather unsafe to walk on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;My husband leaves the house at 6am. The photoes attached were taken around that time on Monday, 29 September, and show how it is pitch black on the path until the light from private properties come on.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Discussing potential reasons for the absence of lighting with other residents on Hill Crescent it was mentioned that some residents may have been bothered by light coming into their property or the presence of bats. The presence of high fences between the path and properties should avoid any light pollution by installing lower lights. The issue of bats was addressed in other councils without putting the public at risk of falling, e.g.: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-hereford-worcester-49534621.amp&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We would appreciate it if you could review and address the issue.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8236151.0.jpeg?46553373&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 28, Becketts Close, Coldblow, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8236151&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
