<title>Burst water/ leaking pipe, 3rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621923</link>
<description>This was reported to Thames water over 2 weeks ago, however the freezing temperatures is causing the water to freeze making the crossing and pathway treacherous. Someone will either slip into the road trying to cross at the pedestrian crossing or break a bone falling on the frozen pavement. The water is gushing also causing pedestrians to be soaked when walking along the pavement&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 5, Brampton Road, Blendon, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621923&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ouside Lemoge Clinic, 3rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621917</link>
<description>I reported the rocking manhole very recently and I received the response that &amp;#39;&amp;#39;Our Inspector has visited this location and found a new cover has been fitted&amp;#39;. The issue remains the same, the manhole might be new as you mentioned in your Fix My Street report but it keeps rocking. I have also raised a formal complaint on Camden&amp;#39;s website (ref COMLR25476). Please send the inspector to check the manhole again and tell them that it must be checked with a car or a vehicle to run over it so you can actually hear it rocking. It keeps rocking while I am writing this message.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Kilburn High Road, Kilburn, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621917&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Signboard missing, lack of countdown, Grasshaven Overall complaint, danger to the environment, 3rd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621892</link>
<description>Dear Royal Borough of Greenwich,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to raise a formal complaint about the continuing neglect of the Thamesmead Moorings map signage at Grasshaven Way, and the wider state of the immediate public realm around it. In or around January 2020, severe winds tore away the large map sign that displayed the local moorings and the Grasshaven Way area. This was not a small decorative item. It was a public wayfinding feature, a marker of local identity, and part of the area’s sense of place. It was also clearly a council installed asset. Years later, it has still not been replaced. That prolonged inaction is unacceptable.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not only about a missing sign. It is about what the absence communicates to residents: that our area is not worth maintaining, that basic public assets can be lost and simply forgotten, and that local culture and pride are optional rather than valued.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is particularly frustrating because the location is not hidden away. It sits in a place people pass and wait, including by the nearby bus stop. Yet there remains a visible lack of care in the immediate environment, including persistent littering and general grime. When everyday public spaces look abandoned, it normalises neglect and invites more of it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;To make matters worse, the bus stop immediately next to this area still lacks a working real time countdown display. Whatever the reason for this, the result is the same: residents are left waiting without reliable passenger information, especially during poor weather. This is exactly the kind of basic service gap that becomes even more aggravating when the surrounding public realm is also visibly uncared for. It also makes the SL11 issue feel even more unreasonable, because residents are expected to tolerate service shortcomings without even the minimum passenger information infrastructure.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am asking the Council to treat this as a matter of public realm standards, resident confidence, and local identity, not as a minor cosmetic request.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please provide a written response addressing the following: 1. Asset record and responsibility Confirm whether the Grasshaven Way Thamesmead Moorings map signage is recorded on your asset register, and which team is responsible for its maintenance and replacement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;2. Replacement commitment and timeline Confirm whether the map signage will be replaced. If yes, provide a clear timetable with target dates for design, procurement, installation, and completion. If no, provide the reasons and the decision maker.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;3. Interim action If replacement will take time, confirm what interim measure will be installed to avoid leaving an obvious “missing” public asset in place for yet another year.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;4. Public realm standards at the site Confirm what actions will be taken to address litter and environmental condition in the immediate area, including what the cleaning schedule is and what enforcement activity is planned where needed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Bus stop real time information 5. Confirm who is responsible for the countdown display at the nearby bus stop and what steps will be taken to install or restore real time passenger information, including expected dates.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;6. Accountability Provide a named officer or team contact and a reference number for this complaint. If this issue has been previously logged, please link it to the existing record.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents are tired of seeing visible neglect normalised. The Council should not need SIX WHOLE YEARS to replace a torn down map and restore basic standards around a key everyday location. If this matter cannot be resolved promptly, I will escalate it through the Council’s complaint stages and to ward councillors.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I look forward to your response within the published timescales for formal complaints.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yours faithfully, Joel Okanta&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8621892.0.jpeg?ecbf99c3&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Central Way, Thamesmead, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8621892&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
