<title>Pot hole on slip road to A13, 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8898439</link>
<description>There is a pot hole at the start of the Wennington slip road that joins the a13 towards lakeside. I cannot attach a photo as it’s not safe to get out in the car here or use my phone while driving, I have attached a screenshot of the location from Apple map and the pothole can be seen however it’s a lot worse now. This is going to cause a lot off issues because people are swerving it now.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8898439.0.jpeg?3b75a396&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8898439&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overhanging tree branch, unable to get into my car., 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8898341</link>
<description>Can the tree be cut by a tree surgeon. It’s over hanging for some time, it hasn’t got many leaves on it now so it will be easy to cut at this time. One branch hits my passengers car window so they cannot exit the car when parked in my private car space. So they get out before I park it. Please can you assess all the trees over hanging on other cars to the left. I could cut it myself but may get into trouble, I’d also need a long extension lead . :) thanks!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8898341.0.jpeg?28cf2876&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Chaucer Drive, Old Kent Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8898341&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Urgent Complaint Regarding Abandoned Street Cleaning, 11th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8898177</link>
<description>Subject Urgent Complaint Regarding Abandoned Street Cleaning at Drovers Place / Leo Street SE15 2RR London.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Dear Sir/Madam, I am writing to formally report the unacceptable and deteriorating environmental conditions at Drovers Place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For several months—possibly up to a year—the street sweeper has completely stopped servicing this area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a result, rubbish has accumulated along the pavements and roadside without any form of regular cleaning or maintenance.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The situation has now reached a critical point. Waste is scattered everywhere, creating an eyesore and, more importantly, a serious public health concern.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The neglected state of the street has turned the area into a breeding ground for rats, cockroaches, and other vermin.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents are increasingly worried about the spread of disease and the safety of children who live and play nearby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It is both alarming and unacceptable that council tax–paying residents are being left to live in such conditions.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Preventative environmental hygiene is far more cost-effective than dealing with the consequences of infestation and illness.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;If this neglect continues, it will inevitably place additional strain on already overstretched NHS resources—something that could and should be avoided through proper local maintenance and accountability.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We deserve clean and safe surroundings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I therefore urge the council to:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Immediately reinstate regular street sweeping services. • Conduct an urgent inspection of the area. • Implement a sustainable cleaning schedule going forward. • Provide residents with a clear explanation for the prolonged absence of service.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This matter requires urgent attention.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I expect a prompt response outlining the steps that will be taken to resolve this issue without further delay.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Yours faithfully, Hygenus Anijah.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Drovers Place, Peckham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8898177&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
