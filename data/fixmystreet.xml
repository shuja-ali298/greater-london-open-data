<title>Lots of Bin bags opened up on Grass Verge, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8914151</link>
<description>Hi, this case again has been wrongfully closed. You have deemed it not the councils responsibility but it is on council land. The labour councillor Jeremy Fosten has confirmed this. It does not form part of the Belvedere park development estate.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We have reported this various times now and we will have to escalate this issue if nothing is done as it has been sitting there for weeks and we pay our council tax.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can you get someone to come and clear this. Jeremy Fosten is aware of this issue&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8914151.0.jpeg?b5e36d56&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Yarnton Way, Lower Belvedere, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8914151&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Road surface, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8914126</link>
<description>The road surface does not seem to be able to take the weight and wear off the busses. There have been some improvements to the road surface but not enough. There have been entire road from start to finish needs improvement. There have busses literally shake and vibrate the houses when they go by both ways every ten minutes. This is particularly frustrating at night when the busses seem to also speed through this road, making the problems worse. I’ve reported this many times but very little is done to bring a solution.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 114, Imperial Way, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8914126&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>East side, behind mazda garage - benches need to be remade and input, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8914125</link>
<description>The benches were destroyed by vandals many years ago - in fact, a lot of the benches have lost integrity and cannot simply sit on them due to being uneven or damaged.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;May I please request more benches to be input around the edges of the field, particularly on the south side, just north of the creek. these are the quiet sides of the field which make more sense to have benches.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would really appreciate this as like many, I use the field for physio and exercise.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I really appreciate benches in this field, particularly under some shade would be good.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Kind regards, Ram&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bourne Road, Crayford, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8914125&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Leaves blocking park drainage in Jubilee Park, 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8914086</link>
<description>This drain block with leaves has been going on for several weeks until finally this week our rear garden is getting flooded due to the rain water not being able to flow out into the drain. The field behind our house is not able to get water flowing into the drain. And it is now a small lake in the grounds. This is also probably imminently going to empty into our rear garden if the drain leaves are not cleared very quickly. Thank you for fixing this problem as soon as possible. We’re very grateful.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8914086.0.jpeg?e52f8067&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Southborough Lane, Southborough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8914086&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Path flooding., 13th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8913850</link>
<description>The gravel pathway within the park consistently experiences flooding due to its initial construction. This pathway was inadequately designed when the park was established to make way for the Bishop Justice Secondary School. A tarmac surface would have provided superior drainage, allowing rainwater to runoff more effectively. The current flooding renders the park inaccessible to elderly and disabled individuals.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8913850.0.jpeg?56e9000e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Magpie Hall Lane, Bromley Common, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8913850&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
