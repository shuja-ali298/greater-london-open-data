<title>Suspected abandoned vehicle in a close, 3rd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804519</link>
<description>This vehicle has been parked in a close on public street within a residential area. The area is Twigg Close, DA8 3LD. This vehicle has never been here before, it was first seen parked on 24th of June 2025. No one has been seen to be entering the vehicle or using the vehicle since that date. It has not moved once. As a residential area, this is where we all park our vehicles for those who dont have a private drive. It is an inconvenience to those living here on this street.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7804519.0.jpeg?c0a480cb&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Twigg Close, Northumberland Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804519&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Abandoned vehicle, 3rd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804507</link>
<description>This vehicle was abandoned/dumped after having possibly been stolen near 2 Priestfield Road SE23 around the end of May 2025. Whilst it is taxed until May 2026, Gov.uk website show it failed its MOT this year with a host of problems. As it is badly parked on the bend in a busy residential road it would be helpful if it could please be checked out and removed ASAP. Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7804507.0.jpeg?613aa6ca&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Priestfield Road, Perry Vale, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804507&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Unstable paving slab sticking up over an inch. Significant trip hazard., 3rd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804502</link>
<description>This paving slap has been repaired many times before recently. The issue, I believe, is rodents burrowing through the sand used to stabilise and level the slab. Needs a concrete Base, rather than just using sand as they quickly burrow back through that...&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7804502.0.jpeg?ac91b225&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Stanhope Grove, Upper Elmers End, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804502&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Roadworks unnecessarily cut off major cycle route, 3rd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804494</link>
<description>The roadworks along Surrey Canal Road/Senegal Road cut off the cycle lane from Ilderton Road, slowing traffic and putting cyclists in danger on what is otherwise a relatively safe route. Only a small portion of the cycle route is cut off, but this puts cyclists right up against the temporary traffic lights. Given the stretch of road is effectively one way, perhaps part of the road could be cordoned off as a cycle route. It is also NOT clear how long this roadwork is going to be there.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Surrey Canal Road, New Cross Gate, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804494&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Graffiti at Weighton Gate Entrance to Betts Park, 3rd July</title>

<description>Graffiti has appeared on the Weighton Gate entrace / exit to Betts Park. With the ongoing works to the Mitre and that entrance being blocked off, people are now forced to use the Weighton Gate entrance. It can be quite intimidating with all the Graffiti around it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7804463.0.jpeg?e0c6c855&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Seymour Villas, Anerley, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804463&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Abandoned property. Front garden overgrown and pigeons living in the house, 3rd July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804458</link>
<description>This house is a continuous problem in our neighbourhood. The lady who owns the property is in a mental home so does not live there and it has become derilict and dangerous to the public. The neighbours have had to step in and cut back the ever growing nettles as it is causing people to be injured by the nettles and bushes when passing by. I was passing myself with my baby in the pram and the hood of my buggy was caught on the nettles. This is terribly dangerous for small children and babies who are level with the bushes and it needs to be a regular occurrence to maintain this property by the council if no one is living there not the responsibility of the neighbours who are baring the brunt of living near this property. There is also pigeons living in the property which is a major pest control problem and is causing toxic chemicals and waste to petrine into neighbouring properties and causing further issues with pigeons in neighbouring properties and damage to cars.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7804458.0.jpeg?a16abaa1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Gipsy Road, West Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804458&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Having just got rid of the last load of rubbish, some more has been dumped.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This time it’s not on the and the pavement, it’s been left in an access alleyway and in a shopping trolley!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As a deterrent is it possible to have a sign put up to say Hidden CCTV - No fly tipping? Or words to that effect. Don’t think actually putting cameras there is worth it, but the sign may act as a deterrent.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7804380.0.jpeg?7773fb21&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Furzefield Road, Kidbrooke, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7804380&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
