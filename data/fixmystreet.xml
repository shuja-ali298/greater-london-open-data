<title>Council activity concern, 29th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8230872</link>
<description>The residents in Enfield are shocked that over the past three years the property developer of 50-54 Church Hill N21, has illegally felled fifty ancient oak trees, with birds nesting each year, on conservation area land and despite us having reported this, no investigation or prosecution has been carried out by Enfield council. Concerningly the council have allowed a planning application for three luxury homes, unaffordable to most people in Enfield and unnecessarily proposed on woodland, already destroyed in full view of our council. This is after the illegal felling of the 1000 year old tree at whitewebbs Toby carvery. Ergin Erbil also claimed he would investigate this and has fallen silent. On Merrivake a similar,y aged tree was felled outside a house owned by someone working with the council during covid. We are concerned about conservations behind closed doors and shocked that a criminal is being allowed to push forward a planning application to fell more trees. The images convey before and after his destruction of wildlife homes. The trees were not ill or damaged and thrived for 100s of years . A criminal investigation is needed rather than a planning application..&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8230872.0.jpeg?59b33a06&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Church Hill, Southgate, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8230872&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Chairs dumped in street, 29th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8230784</link>
<description>There were two chairs dumped at the end of the alleyway approximately one month ago. People are adding to them and the heap has grown, now one more chair and bags of clothes plus graffiti adding to the mess. I think the two original chairs were left for someone to take as they were quite reasonable, but the people never came back to dispose of them.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8230784.0.jpeg?2086c08d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 38,40, Edgehill Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8230784&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flytipped waste now overflowing, 29th September</title>

<description>Behind the back of Grovelands Road flats there is a shared bin with the words &amp;quot;falcon close&amp;quot; on it that has been taken away and filled with building waste and then topped up with household waste that has not been collected for several monthsm&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Previous reports state it is not the problem of the council.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However its not only an environmental hazard, attacting flies and the dumping recently of birds, it&amp;#39;s also now spewing out onto the road and causing a potential hazard to cars when parking and moving up and down the road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can this be removed as soon as possible. If not possible can reasons be stated why the council does not believe this is its responsibility given it&amp;#39;s a council bin and on a road maintained by the council.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8230759.0.jpeg?891465b9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dorchester Close, St Paul&#39;s Cray, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8230759&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
