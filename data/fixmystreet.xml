<title>Contractors not abiding to contract in this area, 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8477252</link>
<description>Salisbury Road is getting like a dumping ground, do the council not realise that a dirty road attracts fly tipping. Why do the contractors no longer clean Salisbury Road &amp;amp; Crown Lane , neither has been cleaned for months. Absolutely disgusting, just telling contractors that it has a complaint DOES NOT MEAN IT IS FIXED, Bromley need to get a grip on this areas street cleaning , as we do pay council tax , for services we are not receiving. Crown Lane hasn&amp;#39;t had a through clean for more than 12 weeks because,SGN was working and still there is rubbish in pavement gullies , and in the gutters .&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8477252.0.jpeg?13ddea7c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Salisbury Road, Southborough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8477252&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Inadequate signage indicating cycle and pedestrian paths, 28th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8477033</link>
<description>The section of the Dollis Valley Greenwalk between Western Way to Totteridge Lane begins as shared use and then splits into a cycle path and a pedestrian path through to Totteridge lane, there are signs at either end of each section indicating which is cycle and which is pedestrian, however these signs are small, aged and vandalised. There are no pathway markings once people have passed the signs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Frequently there are pedestrians on the cycle path, e.g. today, one lady pushing a pram glued to her phone, she would not have seen the signs but might have seen pathway markings.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are frequently dog walkers with unpredictable dogs.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Recently I pings a couple from behind with my bell, having slowed down to almost a stop, and the male took issue with this, I reminded it was a cycle path and he denied it was and threatened to punch me and throw my bike into the brook.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I suspect with proper signage people would realised sooner, or at least when they encounter a bike.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This section of the green walk is on cycle route planners so cyclists do use it, and given there is provision for cycles steps should be taken to reduce conflict and the scope for harm.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dollis Valley Greenwalk, Whetstone, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8477033&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
