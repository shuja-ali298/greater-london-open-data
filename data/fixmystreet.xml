<title>Massive rat infestation, 3rd November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372687</link>
<description>There is a hole in the ground that has not been filled in for several months now, and it now appears to be a rat&amp;#39;s nest. I have passed this hole while waiting for the bus and while walking along the pavement, and have on separate occasions seen multiple rats moving around inside and going into the hole. It is a health and safety hazard and requires urgent attention.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Creek Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372687&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Osborne Road needs more electric charging point on lamp post to help residents who have disabled electric vehicles to be able to charge car.Electric Charging Station. There is only one electronic charging station on Osborne Road and there is multiple vehicles who use it. Hackney Council need to invest more money in electric charging point bays Osborne Road. I am a resident on Semley gate Road and have an electric vehicle. I have also got a permit for Z55 area where I park the car. The closest (only) charging station available is on this semley gate but only permit holders K can use it. I need somewhere to charge my car. If the council do not install more electronic charging ports on Osborne Road it will cause a divide and frustration amongst motorist. There has been an incident in Hackney where one motorist left his car on charged for a whole day. The motorist of this zip higher car was being selfish hogging the charging station point up in Hackney another motorist took the law into his own hands and served justice on this selfish charging hog. Another motorist was unable to use the charging point because of this selfish driver occupying charging points so the other motorists smashed and vandalised the vehicle. The motorist smashed all the windows on the higher car and even smash the side mirrors. This is why hackney council have to put more charging points in because it is causing road rage, vandalism because not everyone can use the charging points. Please Hackney Council do something about this. You have time to invest in line bikes and allocate bay for antisocial behavior line bikes. why not allocate more charging bay, points for residents cars., 3rd November</title>

<description>Please help hackney council invest more in charging points for residents on Osborne road.Relax the road rage and vandalism being caused by frustrated motorists. This was shocking to see.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8372568.0.jpeg?cc8fd719&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Semley Gate, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372568&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Light pollution from P7 50, outside 247 BR4 0HJ, 3rd November</title>

<description>The light from this tall lamp on PIckhurst Lane is emitted outwards, as well as down, towards the road. Strange though it might seem, it shines directly into the rear first floor bedroom at 247 BR4 0BJ and I would like it to be fitted with a baffle to prevent this continuing. I would appreciate personal contact by someone at Bromley Council to discuss this matter.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8372506.0.jpeg?f9e6bc8a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pickhurst Lane, Hayes, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8372506&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
