<description>I reported this pothole under ref 8396102. I was told it was not deemed serious enough for immediate action. I was surprised to hear this as it is quite a big pothole albeit in the middle of the road so I suppose more avoidable for drivers. I was told a decision would be made 14 days after my report but I have not heard anything. I do hope you will reconsider this pothole for repair Many thanks&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Brondesbury Park, Kilburn, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8465163&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Food packaging, boxes, bags of rubbish, microwave oven?, 25th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8465157</link>
<description>All around the bins belonging to Papa John&amp;#39;s Pizza which are in Pope St SE1 there is a large growing pile of food packaging, rubbish bags broken open and spilled onto the pavement. Cardboard boxes along the pavement and what looks like a microwave oven dumped on the pavement. This has been there for about two weeks and someone is adding to the pile. There is food amongst it as pigeons are picking through it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Pope Street, Old Kent Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8465157&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
