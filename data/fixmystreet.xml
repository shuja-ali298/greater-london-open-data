<description>The door of this lighting column is damaged. One corner of the door has been peeled back allowing people access to the wires or for further damage to be done which would allow the entire wire set up to be exposed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There is also a chance of water getting inside and damaging the circuits.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): King&#39;s Cross, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731834&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dog mess in playground, 20th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731806</link>
<description>Lots of dog mess in Mint Street park on the sides of paths that has not been cleaned up. I think some more signs are needed to remind dog owners to clean up their dog’s mess. It’s very unsightly but also dangerous near the children’s playground where a lot of toddlers use the facilities.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 37-48, Marshalsea Road, The Borough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731806&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Broken bottles, 20th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731747</link>
<description>The location of this problem has already been reported here with various bags of rubbish being dumped, but now on a daily basis there is broken bottles with lots of glass littering the pathway of the pavement from the alleyway between Springfield Gardens/Springfield Road and Fairmead Close. This area seems to being used as a dumping ground. There is a disguarded christmas tree complete with a pot, a baby&amp;#39;s bouncing chair. It has frequently had problems of this kind but recently it is getting out of hand and dangerous to walk through and the area is used often with children going to and from school.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8731747.0.jpeg?3b88fe9a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Fairmead Close, Southborough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731747&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The bins on Mint Street are always overflowing and there are always a lot of things left there without being taken for weeks.

<title>Overgrown footpath, 20th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731633</link>
<description>This is Kentish Road bus stop I have a pram and a young baby I struggle getting off the bus here due to the over grown trees and bushes. It is a safety issue as it is a very crowded area with parked cars on the hill with the path also being blocked by the trees it obscures the view of the road for pedestrians. I also struggle to push my pram along when getting off at the stop using the path to go up to All Saints Church of a Sunday and access to Nuxley road. Pedestrians and public transport users are not valued in the borough shown by the state of the paths, train station and bus stops. Cars are allowed to park right up to the junction on Abbey Crescent and this overgrowth with this issue is an accident waiting to happen.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8731633.0.jpeg?23ee8ea3&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Picardy Road, Lower Belvedere, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731633&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
