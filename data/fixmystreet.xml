<title>Broken glass, 9th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7835328</link>
<description>The state of this cycle path is completely - and consistently - unacceptable. I use it every week and every single time there is broken glass absolutely everywhere. I‚Äôm surprised any cyclists actually use it - I would rather take my chances in the road. I don‚Äôt know who spends their weekends throwing bottles onto Vauxhall Bridge but it clearly needs a proper cleaning and enforcement schedule - not just sporadic sweeping. This is a major commuting route and instead of enabling active travel it is putting thousands of people off, costing cyclists money in puncture repairs and endangering our safety.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Vauxhall Bridge, Vauxhall, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7835328&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
