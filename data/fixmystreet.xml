<title>Damaged pavement, 15th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7882960</link>
<description>I tripped over damaged paving which cut my head open severely and resulted in me laying in the road covered in blood. I was with my child who was hysterical as I was dazed. A neighbour came out to help and my son ran to get his nan who’s house we was walking back from. An ambulance was called and they assessed and took a statement. My partner had to leave work early to take me to the hospital resulting in him loosing money. I was sent to hospital where I got stitches. I have a huge scar and black eye. The location are outside Bancroft house, Woodside Crescent DA15. The neighbour that helped lives at Rosalyn house Woodside Crescent DA15. I live at 15 Woodside Crescent DA15 7JJ. I have photos of it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 16, Woodside Crescent, Longlands, Sidcup, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7882960&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Gate in Peabody estate alley between Blocks C/D not closing, 15th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7882933</link>
<description>The gate to the estate stops the public using the alley as a public toilet. It’s being chained open by a resident. It’s a major health hazard as there’s daily faeces and urine in the alley. It would be healthier to have the gate closed so only estate residents have access via key fob.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Kemble Street, Holborn, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7882933&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>The mattress dumped on Parkdale Road still there after the first report, 15th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7882889</link>
<description>Mattress dumped on the Parkdale Road just past after Chestnut/ Parkdale intersection. Along with the second one dumped a few meters down it is a health hazard, makes it difficult for people with disabilities and strollers to walk on the pavement safely. It is also probably collecting bacteria by the hour- a health hazard. Please pick it up before a third report. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7882889.0.jpeg?6a14ea87&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Parkdale Road, Plumstead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7882889&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>No through road sign not readable, 15th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7882876</link>
<description>The road sign for Dunstan&amp;#39;s Grove is very faded and worn. While you can still identify the road name, the &amp;quot;no through road&amp;quot; symbol is not really visible from Dunstan&amp;#39;s Road. This means many, many cars speed down Dunstan&amp;#39;s Grove each day, thinking it is a cut through to Forest Hill road avoiding the lights at the end of Dunstan&amp;#39;s Road. As there is no turning space at the end of Dunstan&amp;#39;s Grove all the cars then make multiple point turns and speed out of the cul de sac. This is not ideal as there is nursery at the end of Dunstan&amp;#39;s Grove with young children and parents making their way to and from the nursery daily. Because it is a cul de sac pedestrians tend to be lulled in to a false sense of security that there will be no cars so don&amp;#39;t take the care they should crossing the road. Cars in the road are also frequently bumped or dented by drivers making multiple point turns having mistakenly entered Dunstan&amp;#39;s Grove.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7882876.0.jpeg?126b4cf7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Dunstan&#39;s Grove, Nunhead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7882876&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
