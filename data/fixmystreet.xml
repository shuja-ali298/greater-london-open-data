<title>Continued Disturbance, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779511</link>
<description>Is this now a 24 hour allotment. Why are businesses ie Smith &amp;amp; Brock working on allotment late at night and persons in there at 1am ish in morning. Only for more activity at 6:45am. It is about time this was turned into a proper allotment not a shanty town that it has become&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7779511.0.jpeg?0407662c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 297, Old Farm Avenue, Longlands, Sidcup, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779511&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fridge still here after 57 days, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779510</link>
<description>I first reported this fridge 57 days ago. It&amp;#39;s been marked as completed 3 times on Love Clean Streets, yet is definitely still here. We&amp;#39;ve dragged it into the gutter but it was still left out of a clearance of other flytipping over a week ago. Why won&amp;#39;t the council clear this fridge? Another person&amp;#39;s report on this app has also been removed! Please please can the fridge be cleared.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7779510.0.jpeg?7a8855be&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hyndewood, Forest Hill, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779510&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Formal Complaint and Request for Resolution Regarding Mobile Signal Disruption and Estate Impact on Quality of Life, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779443</link>
<description>Dear Sir/Madam,&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I am writing to formally raise concerns regarding serious disruptions to my mobile and internet connectivity, and to request an immediate review and practical resolution from the Council.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Directly opposite from Aylesford Street, approximately 3 to 4 metres away, stands a recently developed eight-storey council estate across from 3 storey buildings from ground level. Since its completion, I have experienced a severe and persistent degradation in mobile phone signal and data access inside my home. I currently subscribe to a 3G, 4G, 5G service through Vodafone provider and have previously had reliable service everywhere I go, even on the underground tube. However, I now receive virtually no signal within my property, constantly registering zero bars, making it impossible to make phone calls or use internet services on my phone, laptop, or computer without leaving the house entirely and walking down the street. I work from home due to accessible needs as a professional full time and cannot do anything in terms of work or personal.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is not only deeply inconvenient but has serious implications for both my professional and personal life. As someone who works from home, access to reliable mobile and internet services is essential. The current situation prevents me from performing basic work functions, including attending virtual meetings, making business calls, or accessing cloud-based tools. In some instances, I am forced to walk to the far end of the street, where the housing block ends, near Grosvenor Road, just to establish any kind of connection!&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Furthermore, the implications for health and safety are deeply concerning. In the event of an emergency, I would be unable to call emergency services without physically exiting my home and travelling a considerable distance to find a signal. This is an unacceptable risk and a breach of reasonable living standards.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The structure of the estate appears to be directly interfering with signal strength, and I am also concerned that this obstruction could have long-term effects on property values and the viability of the home as a modern, functional dwelling-particularly in light of increasing national policies around working from home and digital access being a basic utility.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given the seriousness of the matter, I respectfully request the Council to investigate the following:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Immediate assessment of the impact of the estate structure on telecommunications access for surrounding residents. • Provision of a practical resolution, such as installation of signal boosters, repeaters, or Wi-Fi infrastructure paid for by the Council or in partnership with telecommunications providers. • Clear communication of findings and proposed steps, including a timeline for resolution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This issue is having a measurable and detrimental impact on my quality of life and ability to work as a full time professional. I trust the Council will recognise the severity of the situation and respond promptly with appropriate support and a proposed solution.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I would be grateful for written confirmation of receipt of this complaint and an update on the Council&amp;#39;s next steps as soon as possible as this is affecting everyday life.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Aylesford Street, Pimlico, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779443&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dumped Rubbish by your Street Cleaning Contractor - Countrystyle, 29th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779435</link>
<description>Third report: Cinema Public Car Park, 22 Broadway, Bexleyheath, DA6 7RB: Please could you ask your street cleaning contractor - Countrystyle to stop dumping their blue waste sacks outside of this car park - as seen in the attached pictures. Quite frankly, it looks a mess, it attracts foxes and other vermin, encourages fly-tipping and is not a temporary dumping ground. Please remove these items and ask the contractor to stop leaving their rubbish here.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7779435.0.jpeg?d7e4d29f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Broadway, Barnehurst, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779435&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Trees overhanging, 28th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779376</link>
<description>The trees are overhanging the roads, the buses are constantly smashing off of them. I have a daughter who is awake most of the summer nights, as the windows have to be open but the awful noise of these trees catapulting off of the buses is keeping her awake. They are so overhung in both the road and on the pavement it’s is becoming impossible to walk without having to duck. It’s also dangerous as the branches are being snapped off from the gravity of the buses and pinging everywhere, it won’t be long before someone gets hurt. The tree outside of 24 Dartmouth Park Hill is bending so much that it is pulling out of the ground and lifrjnf the pavement, this has resulted in people falling and tripping over the lifted pavement Slabs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dartmouth Park Hill, Archway, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7779376&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
