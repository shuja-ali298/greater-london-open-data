<description>There is a tow truck parked outside my house which is well over the double yellow lines. This parking is illegal and it’s on a corner and there is a parked car on the other side so it’s a tight squeeze.

<title>Dog mess in playground, 20th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731806</link>
<description>Lots of dog mess in Mint Street park on the sides of paths that has not been cleaned up. I think some more signs are needed to remind dog owners to clean up their dog’s mess. It’s very unsightly but also dangerous near the children’s playground where a lot of toddlers use the facilities.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 37-48, Marshalsea Road, The Borough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731806&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Broken bottles, 20th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731747</link>
<description>The location of this problem has already been reported here with various bags of rubbish being dumped, but now on a daily basis there is broken bottles with lots of glass littering the pathway of the pavement from the alleyway between Springfield Gardens/Springfield Road and Fairmead Close. This area seems to being used as a dumping ground. There is a disguarded christmas tree complete with a pot, a baby&amp;#39;s bouncing chair. It has frequently had problems of this kind but recently it is getting out of hand and dangerous to walk through and the area is used often with children going to and from school.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8731747.0.jpeg?3b88fe9a&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Fairmead Close, Southborough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8731747&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
