<title>3 abandoned litter bins obstructing pavement, 4th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8377279</link>
<description>3 abandoned litter bins obstructing pavement. Situated right near a tree. Makes it really difficult to get past (wheelchair and pram especially). Ive repeatedly complained about this. The bins used to be left there by no 20 vernham road . These bins are un-numbered. They attract fly tipping also.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8377279.0.jpeg?32f91e49&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Vambery Road, Shooters Hill, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8377279&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water leak on footpath to erith station, 4th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8377242</link>
<description>The water leak down the path towards erith station has been happening for over a year. The water smells like it is contaminated or is sewage. With the leaves it is a slip hazard and people are having accidents as half the path is now permanently wet and leaves are mixed in. The weather is getting colder and once it starts the freeze over, this will be an even more serious hazard.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Stonewood Road, Northumberland Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8377242&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Roadside vendors, Trip and fall hazard pallets on footpath, 4th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8377199</link>
<description>It’s very obvious that the sweet vendors are leaving their rubbish on the footpath after they close. This is unacceptable ,the footpath is not a dumping ground. I mean, no member of the public would purchase that many items and just leave the waste on the road or footpath. Clearly, it’s the street vendors who are doing this. How can someone leave a whole pallet in the middle of the footpath? Please do check the camera actually during the daytime there is a fruit windor near the corner of the street, but need to double chech he is doing it or not.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8377199.0.jpeg?bbf8f3d7&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 46, Rye Lane, Peckham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8377199&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
