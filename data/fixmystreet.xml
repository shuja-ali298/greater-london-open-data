<description>There was an accumulation of leaves on our street. They were wet and slippery so a potential hazard. They were also blocking the gullies which caused flooding in previous years. I cleared the sidewalks and gullies and there are now three bags of leaves outside number 100. Please can you collect them.

<title>Dumped cabinets and a bag of clothing, 16th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427025</link>
<description>Dumped household renovation waste was cleared by the council on Saturday morning, but by Sunday morning, someone has dumped broken cabinets and a bag of clothes, in the same spot. This is so frustrating and annoying. Can Bromley Council install a cctv above the shop front window. This may result in irresponsible fly tippers being named and prosecuted. This spot has become a favourite place for local fly tippers, who have no pride in where they and we live. They are happy for other people to be stepping around rubbish, which should&amp;#39;ve been disposed of at the local refuse dump&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 210, Venner Road, Penge, London Borough of Bromley&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427025&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large white van has been parked right next to the junction for months now without moving causing real safety hazard as so close to junction, 16th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427010</link>
<description>Three vans have been parked in a row at the end of Winchfield Road for around 3 months now. A large white van shown in the photo -‘d then behind that a smaller yellow van and then another white van. The large white van and yellow van have not been moved at all in that time. Nobody on the street seems to know who they belong to but people seem to think somebody is actually living in one of them. The main issue however is the fact that the large white van at the front is parked about 1 metre from the junction and I lots of other neighbours feel it’s really dangerous as forces you to drive out into the wrong lane when you’re approaching the junction so people have nearly crashed. Whilst I appreciate its technically not illegal to be parked there I do really think it is causing an unnecessary obstruction and so it won’t be long before it causes a crash. Also they seemingly don’t belong to anyone in the street but rather someone has just decided to park up and live there. Can someone please come and have a look and get them to move them?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8427010.0.jpeg?95653c50&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Winchfield Road, Perry Vale, Sydenham, London Borough of Lewisham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8427010&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Graffiti sprayed on wall at 1 Thornton Street SW9 6AG also in close proximity graffiti tags sprayed on white door opposite at 1 Drenchworth House SW9., 16th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8426988</link>
<description>I like to report graffiti sprayed on a cream wall at 1 Thornton Street, Brixton london SW9. The graffiti faces a white door in very close proximity also sprayed with graffiti by the same culprit. The door is by the beginning of 1 Drenchworth House although not connected. Hopefully the images can specify for you the exact location. Please can the graffiti be removed. The graffiti has been there for a little over a month.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8426988.0.jpeg?d901a87e&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 300-302, Brixton Road, Brixton, London Borough of Lambeth&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8426988&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
