<title>Writing on signs in Lesnes Abbey Woods, 2nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617634</link>
<description>Writing appeared on lots of signs in Lesnes Abbey Woods. It mainly reads: &amp;quot;dairy trade rape trade&amp;quot;. I was quite worried when I saw it, but after some research, it seems to be something animal activists usually write. I came across it on at least 5 different signs near the Woodland Way area.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8617634.0.jpeg?bebc3022&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): New Road, West Heath, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617634&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Rubbish overflowing in multiple areas, 2nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617564</link>
<description>I am reporting a significant and ongoing decline in the condition of Perryn Road (SE16 4DA). The area has become a hotspot for several interconnected issues that require urgent intervention from Southwark Council: Accumulated Waste &amp;amp; Fly-tipping: There is a constant buildup of uncollected rubbish and &amp;quot;junk&amp;quot; on the pavement. This is attracting vermin and has made the street look derelict and rundown. The recycling bins haven&amp;#39;t been collected for 2 weeks and there is a mountain of waste now (see picture). Furniture is regularly left behind the bins (mattresses, toilets, etc.). Rough Sleeping &amp;amp; Obstruction: An individual has moved onto the street (corner of Perryn Road and Drummond Road) along with a significant amount of discarded items and litter. While I am concerned for the individual&amp;#39;s welfare, the accumulation of junk is obstructing the footway and adding to the general waste problem. (see picture). Public Health &amp;amp; Sanitation (Urination): The corner closer to the tube station is being used as a public urinal by individuals exiting the station. This is creating a persistent, foul odour and constitutes a biohazard for local residents. The businesses on Jamaica Road have their service entrances on Perryn Road, and they often discard various liquids in the street drains, and these sometimes overflow. I&amp;#39;ve attached a picture of some light liquid I spotted the other day. Action Requested: Immediate street cleansing and disinfection of the corner to address the smell and hygiene risk. Removal of the fly-tipped items and uncollected waste. Referral of the rough sleeper to the Southwark outreach team (START) for assessment and relocation. Increased enforcement or signage to deter anti-social behaviour (public urination) at this specific corner.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8617564.0.jpeg?f2820802&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1-14, Perryn Road, Bermondsey, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617564&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Water pouring from drain and black ice, 2nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617536</link>
<description>There is water pouring out of 2 x manholes which is pouring down the road. There is also black ice in this area and at the bottom of Broadcroft Road. Two cars got stuck earlier and with the cold weather set to continue and water pouring from the manhole covers there could be a serious accident. Salt really needs to be put on the road and the water main needs fixing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8617536.0.jpeg?2c8e2374&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Broadcroft Road, Poverest, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617536&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dog poo everywhere, 2nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617519</link>
<description>There is dog waste everywhere, especially on grace road. I have a dog myself and it&amp;#39;s really upsetting that people are so selfish not to pick it up. I took 10 photos on one walk today to share. There needs to be sufficient fines, it&amp;#39;s getting worse each week. I see no signs anywhere to help prevent this and I never see the dog water bin emptied.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Plus the streets in general are never cleaned, there&amp;#39;s rubbish everywhere. This is not just because of the Christmas period. I want to feel proud of my street Dagmar Road but instead I am embarrassed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;What can be done?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8617519.0.jpeg?a82d8091&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 31, Graces Road, Camberwell, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617519&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dangerously icy roads, 2nd January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617439</link>
<description>I&amp;#39;m unsure if this is the correct place to report this, I apologise if not&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, I believe this road is incredibly icy and dangerous, I was going through in a cab and the car almost slid to the side going around the corner, we were going luckily quite slow, but there are massive patches of ice all along this road but no other road I&amp;#39;ve seen nearby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I also know many large trucks, and cargo vans use this back road as there is industrial sites nearby.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I&amp;#39;m wondering if a possible emergency salting could be done to prevent any unfortunate but now foreseen situations occuring?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Also, just a thought from myself, perhaps an investigation into the safety of this road and whether upkeep is necessary to prevent any potential damages or, worse, in future?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Old Maidstone Road, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8617439&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
