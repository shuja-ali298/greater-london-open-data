<title>Community hall bin not emptied for 3 weeks, 24th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8460479</link>
<description>The Coldharbour Community Hall bin hasn&amp;#39;t been collected for 3 weeks. This is not the first time, I have had to run across the road to tell them. They tell me it gets collected every week which is not true and I hate council staff lie to me when they keep driving past when I&amp;#39;m there. Please can you get your staff to collect every week after they do the Nisa store across the road&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8460479.0.jpeg?e72d6365&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): William Barefoot Drive, Eltham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8460479&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Glass on street outside Brotherhood of the Cross &amp; Star and private bin area, 24th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8460332</link>
<description>On County Street, opposite Brotherhood of Cross and Star building, the bin area for Tavern Court appears to have waste dumped from externally. The access gate is normally unlocked to allow bin collection weekly, and it appears someone has gained access illegally. Glass can be seen on the street from where the materials appear to have been dragged in. We do not have evidence of anyone seeing the act, but sounds were heard late on the evening of 9-November. On the 24th of November, similar type of glass was noted to have been dumped right outside the pavement of the Brotherhood of the Cross and Star. Unfortunately this is being dumped overnight and appears to be a deliberate act of fly tipping&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8460332.0.jpeg?88fbd169&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): County Street, Elephant and Castle, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8460332&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ashfield parade illegal parking problem, 24th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8460228</link>
<description>Around Ashfield parade there is a continuous illegal parking problem causing a great deal of distress for local residents; This problem seems to be caused by non-nationals illegally parking: 1. On the taxi rank 2. On corners causing obstructions and bottlenecks to traffic flow 3. No traffic enforcement is in effect whatsoever 4. Double yellow lines must be painted on all the corners and bends on and around Ashfield parade and surrounding roads; 5. The taxi rank is of no use to taxi&amp;#39;s and is being used soley as car parking by non-national tradesmen; 6. Why is this problem being ignored ??&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2-16, Burleigh Gardens, Brunswick Park, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8460228&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
