<title>Discarded wooden panels doors shelves, 16th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887681</link>
<description>This location is regularly putting out discarded wooden panels, doors, shelving, carpet remnants along the pavements in front of the building (flats above and shop and office below). They also put out fridges ovens freezers and a report was filed recently with reference number 7862640. Unfortunately the discarded wooden panels shelving etc are still there, now moved to lean against their doorway into the flats. Can the Council please serve notice to get these removed they are an eyesore. Additionally, we and other old folk have stumbled on the paved area which has parking posts as it is completely uneven and has never been repaired in over 15+ years we have lived here. Can the Council please serve notice to get this area repaired and made safe as it is a Health and Safety hazard which is completely ignored by the responsible party/parties. Sidcup is a area which is loved by it&amp;#39;s long time residents and this hazardous area has definitely been ignored by it&amp;#39;s owners believing the Council is soft and will not serve notice on them to get this hazardous area fully repaired. They conduct their flooring and building business with impunity and regularly use these pavement areas as a dumping ground. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Rectory Lane, Albany Park, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887681&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Weeding needed in De Laune and Harmsworth Street, 16th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887572</link>
<description>The entire lenths of De Laune and Harmsworth - and I expect Sharsted and Faunce Street have not been weeded for months. The streets also need sweeping, as they have not been swept for months either and are looking very messy. Street sweeping and weeding, alongside litter picking, used to be done on a regular basis in this area. Could this please be re-introduced so we don&amp;#39;t have to keep reporting these things? Many thanks!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7887572.0.jpeg?4a4e4f82&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Harmsworth Street, Elephant and Castle, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7887572&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The bags have been causing an obstruction for over a week, it’s just another issue that is ongoing beside No 38 Manor Way, which is in a shocking state and needs professional cleaning and fumigation.
