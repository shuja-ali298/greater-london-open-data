<title>Large tree in Garden of 21 Burma Road, 22nd October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8326719</link>
<description>Tree has grown and overhangs multiple neighbouring properties. The tree drops a large amount of debris, which regularly blocks drainage systems causing water damage and mould to properties even a few doors down. It’s too tall to access for a boundary cut.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8326719.0.jpeg?fa92336d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Burma Road, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8326719&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Northfield House recycling bins ongoing issues, 22nd October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8326708</link>
<description>Please see the two pics attached - one of the bins at Frensham end, the other at Old Kent/Peckham Park Road end of Northfield House carpark. The Frensham Street bins have been emptied today (Wed 22 Oct) as usual with the regular recycling collection. The others, however, have been left in this state. The bin on the left has been emptied but the bin on the right has for the past few weeks been marked &amp;quot;do not use&amp;quot; - but has been left in place, with the result that it keeps getting used. It is not acceptable to mark a bin, leave it in place, and then not empty it. It has been like this for over a fortnight now. If the bin is no longer usable, it needs to be removed and replaced, not just ignored. And as for the rubbish on the ground, why it has been left there by the collectors today, I do not know. This ongoing bins situation at this site is unfair on residents and Southwark itself and an eyesore and a health hazard. We do our best to keep Northfield nice, but Southwark is really failing us here.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8326708.0.jpeg?ac60f2de&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Peckham Park Road, Peckham, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8326708&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fly tipping, 22nd October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8326587</link>
<description>I have attached the pictures of these two men dumping their concrete bags. It has been happening every other day. As soon as waste collection is taken away these men and others bring their rubbish to dump here. This place is located SE9 5ED Eltham hill. Because of dirt spread everywhere our house block looks like a junk yard and people repeatedly keep doing it. I had reported before but no action was taken and reporting it again.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8326587.0.jpeg?e5091a7b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 134-144, Eltham Hill, Well Hall, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8326587&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Inappropriate Parking Location, 22nd October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8326552</link>
<description>The section of road immediately in front of 27 Thistlefield Cl is not long enough to safely park a vehicle. Despite this, it is regularly used for parking which obstructs either or both of the driveways on either side of it - something I understand to be an offence according to the highway code. When cars are parked here it causes an obstruction on the street for larger vans or lorries (including garbage collection vehicles) who cannot easily or safely pass.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It also causes obstruction to the residents of 25, 26, 27, 28 and 29 Thistlefield Cl who have allocated parking here as well as visitors or delivery vehicles to this area.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Recently, a lorry hit a car parked in this section of road when trying to exit the parking area/driveway, because a car was parked part way across the driveway and the lorry could not make a complete turn left out of the driveway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This section of road should be marked with double yellow lines to maintain safe access and egress both to the rest of Thistlefield Close and the driveways and allocated parking surrounding it.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Alternatively, wardens should patrol this area more frequently to deter the recent increase of inappropriate parking here.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 28, Thistlefield Close, Albany Park, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8326552&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
