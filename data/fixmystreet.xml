<title>No lights on bridge over station, 11th November</title>

I also have a deaf friend who has been scared several times whilst crossing&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Whitehall Lane, North End, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8401825&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>PUBLIC DANGER - Huge quantities of fallen leaves unswept., 10th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8401629</link>
<description>It’s autumn, we get it, leaves fall. But with the quantity of dropped leaves and the infrequent sweeping - it has really become a hazard. It is impossible to see the edge of the curb/pavement which is a tripping risk. And the leaves are, of course, slippery when wet. Why don’t you leave sacks with residents to sweep and bag the fallen leaves, which you then pick up? My brown bin is completely full as is that of neighbouring properties. So give residents some bags and we will supplement the council services which are no longer provided.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 84, East Dulwich Road, East Dulwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8401629&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
