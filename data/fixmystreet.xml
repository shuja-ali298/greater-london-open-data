<description>This car has been illegally parking/abandoned on this spot since 22nd September without movement. This is a private land and the law states that the local authority must give 15 days notice to propose to remove the vehicle. It’s been more than a month since the last report on this car on this site and almost 2 months since the car is parked without movement. The car needs to be towed away&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8406220.0.jpeg?7c8f63cc&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Hubbard Street, Greenwich&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8406220&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Food and hazardous waste dumping, 11th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8406198</link>
<description>I’m reporting repeated incidents of illegal commercial waste dumping by food trucks operating at 103 Union Street, London SE1 0LA, managed by Samsite Ltd (one of the 9 vendors operating out of the site is dumping here). They have been regularly discarding meat waste, used oil cans, and other rubbish into the residential bins outside my property. We have had more rats, oil spills and rotten food smell from the waste that they are putting in the residential bins.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This has caused overflowing bins, strong smells, and hygiene issues. As per the Environmental Protection Act 1990, commercial waste must not be disposed of in domestic bins, and this activity amounts to fly-tipping.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I took these pictures this evening of these bins overflowing with mostly oil cans this time. I have previous pictures of the guys dumping rotten food, and hazardous waste from the food into the bins (including videos of where they are coming out of).&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8406198.0.jpeg?fe65d4db&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Southwark Bridge Road, The Borough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8406198&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Road markings are very faded, 11th November</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8406180</link>
<description>Can the road markings please be repainted as cars frequently continue from lane 2 on Mildred road onto lane to on Westhorne avenue, when they should be proceeding into lane 3 of Westhone ave according to the faded lines. I typically approach from lane 1 of Mildred and drive toward lane 2 of Westhone as per the markings, however am frequently cut up by those is lane 2. In addition to repainting the lines signage would also be very useful. Perhaps a traffic survey would be worth it to monitor the lane usage.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8406180.0.jpeg?4ce97c31&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Westhorne Avenue, Hither Green, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8406180&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
