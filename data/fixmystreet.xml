<title>Next door neighbour tree lifting our patio plus their bamboo coming through on our side, 6th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816357</link>
<description>The next door neighbours tree lifts our patio paving. They have cut it back but it&amp;#39;s still growing. They also have a huge bamboo that is coming through to our garden. The pic is 1 time it has come through but since then has also shot up on our side again. We are concerned also about it spreading underground &amp;amp; it is breaking the fence. The tree has started lifting the patio about a year ago &amp;amp; the bamboo a couple of years. We have messaged the owner a number of times over the years about the bamboo and he says he will remove it but never does.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7816357.0.jpeg?7e279c9c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Park End, Plaistow, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816357&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Tree needs maintenance council property, 6th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816285</link>
<description>Hi My council neighbour at 6 Shrubland rd used to prune this big tree. I don&amp;#39;t think he&amp;#39;s fit enough to continue as a result it&amp;#39;s very big and the tree is growing branches in the lower part meaning that it is likely to damage the listed railings&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7816285.0.jpeg?c91f5662&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Shrubland Road, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816285&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Overgrown Japanese Knotweed – Flat 201A Lordship Lane, 6th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816277</link>
<description>I am writing to report an urgent issue regarding an overgrown and potentially hazardous infestation of Japanese knotweed in the rear garden at Flat 201A Lordship Lane.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The garden has been abandoned for years, and the japanese knotweed is now visibly spreading into the neighbouring property at Flat 199A, raising serious concerns due to the invasive nature of this plant and the potential structural damage it can cause. We have attempted to contact the property owner without success, and the situation is escalating.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given the urgency of this issue, we kindly request that the Council investigates and takes steps to contact the owner of Flat 201A to ensure immediate remedial action is taken, as there is a clear risk the weed will expand to all surronding gardens, threatening numerous buildings.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 22, Landcroft Road, East Dulwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816277&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Car has been reported previously. Car have now been parked there for over 2 weeks. Someone have thrown a brick through the back window. It is also left on a bend of the road which will cause an accident very soon. Traffic is building up as there is a narrow gap between cars. This is not fair on local residence with build up of traffic.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7816234.0.jpeg?e32d2dcc&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Upper Wickham Lane, Plumstead, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816234&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pavement parking only on one side near junction, 6th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816225</link>
<description>Today we were unable to get through with our Fire Appliance due to parking issues at the west end of Horsa road. There is pavement parking permitted along most of the street but not on the South side near the junction with Brook Street. This means cars are parking in the road making it too narrow. This section also needs pavement parking or a double yellow to prevent parking altogether as Emergency vehicles can not get through.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 124, Horsa Road, Northumberland Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7816225&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
