<title>Loose setts at top of Hatherley Road, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154474</link>
<description>The granite setts forming the road surface at the top of Hatherley Road (Sidcup High St end) are loose and not fixed securely - they make an unacceptable amount of noise when you drive over them and loose setts are a hazardous surface for cars and pedestrians that obviously needs to be replaced. These issues are far more important than the look of the setts - in fact the loose setts makes Sidcup look like a badly maintained area - PLEASE can you just replace them with normal road surface asap. Also it is dangerous for children and the partially sighted - there is no clear separation between the road and the pavement. This problem has been there for over a year (far too long).&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hatherley Road, Longlands, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154474&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bollard defaced, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154409</link>
<description>This bollard was defaced by a utility firm YEARS ago. The tape has been there ever since. All over Westminster utility companies are defacing street furniture in this way and it is never cleaned up. I recently returned from a drive all round France Spain and Portugal - I saw nothing like this anywhere! Can our council please show some civic pride and clean this stuff up? And can the utility companies defacing our environment please be called to account?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8154409.0.jpeg?64dc1416&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 20, Great Peter Street, Millbank, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154409&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ugly tape on bollards, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154392</link>
<description>All over Westminster and especially Horseferry Rd, utility companies have left hideous plastic tape on elegant street furniture like bollards. In many cases they have been there for years. I have contacted the environmental team and been ignored. It is utterly defacing and degrading the environment. How can we get ALL this stuff removed?&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8154392.0.jpeg?0a453250&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Horseferry Road, Millbank, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154392&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Complete Painting of Double Line in front of CHM, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154347</link>
<description>In early 2020 I reported a severe risk to Health &amp;amp; Safety for the residents and owners who live down the drive of Coachhouse Mews. It was captured by yourselves under #2168614 and you responded on 23/06/202 10:46 saying that the issue was being passed to traffic management team. The risk that I raised is that 50 Anerley Park which contains 8-9 flats and 1-3 Coachhouse Mews also are down this drive. When I raised the initial complaint action was taken and double lines were painted to stop people parking in front of the entryway to assist emergency services if they needed to reach us in an emergency that has been the case on multiple ocassitions since we moved here in 2008, however there was a vehicle parked where the traffic management team wanted to paint the line so as you can see in the photograph the double yellow line was not extended fully and people often don&amp;#39;t consider it as a double line as it is broken away from the main double line. As there is presently roadworks happening and no cars are permitted on the section of road I&amp;#39;m speaking of can a proper a full double yellow line be painted. I hope that makes sense and is clear. We have had to get fire trucks and ambulances down the small drive and it is often very difficult for them to make the turn in order to get down the drive if cars are parked on the double line.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8154347.0.jpeg?2badfcf8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Anerley Park, Crystal Palace, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154347&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Would it be possible for Wardens to patrol Fernhead Road and Shirland Road?, 11th September</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154303</link>
<description>Would it be possible for Wardens to patrol Fernhead Road and Shirland Road? Because these roads are rife with dog fouling. Despite you putting up signs encouraging dog owners to clean up after their dogs, many of these signs have been pulled down to pavement level! And they are ignored. Other streets that have these signs, they have not been pulled down! The culprits must live in one of these streets! I have actually had dog fouling thrown at the wall where I live and have had dog fouling put inside my dustbins! Thank you in anticipation.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 97, Fernhead Road, Kensal Town, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8154303&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
