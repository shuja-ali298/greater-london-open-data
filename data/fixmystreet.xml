<title>Chester Gate Traffic Crossing on Albany Street, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8860192</link>
<description>These works and the temp lights are the biggest mismanaged disaster in a quiet resident area in a protected conservation area environment. The lights temp in place are not working. This is causing enormous noise disturbance. Via traffic. Angry car drivers beeping horns 24/7. Cars ignoring and driving beyond red lights so clashing and not moving to let either pass. Language swearing and aggression. It’s utterly awful. This is a highly mismanaged project. I spoke to the engineers themselves and they said the lights have not worked since the start of the work placing them in the line of attack by horns and angry drivers. This places them in a dangerous working condition which breaches their own H and S, it places residents at danger as the aggression is massive of angry drivers. It’s not being managed. No one is assisting and acting on reports of issues. The police have seen due to massive car issue and tried to report.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8860192.0.jpeg?4cf59e88&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1-30, Robert Street, Fitzrovia, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8860192&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
