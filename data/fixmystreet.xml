<title>Mountain of bed bug infested furniture stacked precariously on pavement, 28th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8783295</link>
<description>The furniture labeled &amp;#39;Do not take, has mites!&amp;#39; has been there for 5 days and belongs to tenants at 14 Vicarage Grove. Have spoken to the neighbour. The tipping appears to be the entire content of the house - chairs, tables, bed frames, mattresses. It is stacked precariously and keeps falling and blocking the foot path.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Vicarage Grove, Camberwell, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8783295&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>1 street light was not working around the war memorial as of 27/01/26. I think it was the one I have highlighted. If not it was definitely one on that side, cinema side of the junction.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 237, High Street, Beckenham, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8783282&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Cracked road, 28th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8783280</link>
<description>This issue has previously been attended by contractors, including JB Riney, however the repeated response has been to simply resurface the area with tarmac. As someone working within the engineering industry, I personally attended site during one of these visits and spoke directly with the operatives. I was informed that the underlying cause is a cracked plate beneath the carriageway, which is leading to continual surface failure and significant vibration. This explains why the issue repeatedly returns and why resurfacing alone has not resolved the problem. The road in question is also a number 51 bus route. Buses regularly use this stretch of road to recover lost time and are travelling at speeds in excess of 30 mph over the defect. This is not only causing severe vibration to the property but also presents a clear safety risk to residents, road users, and bus passengers. Heavy vehicles repeatedly passing over a known structural defect at speed is unacceptable. The impact on my parents has been severe. In August last year, following a serious operation, my mother contacted the council to explain that the vibration was so intense she could not sleep in her own bed and was forced to recover on the sofa. The situation has now worsened to the point where the entire house shakes in every room when vehicles pass. This is not normal living conditions and should not be tolerated.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8783280.0.jpeg?6af93d10&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 62, Wellington Avenue, Blackfen, Sidcup, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8783280&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
