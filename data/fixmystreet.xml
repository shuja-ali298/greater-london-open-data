<title>Massive pile of rubbish blocks access to 4 flats, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8991419</link>
<description>Over the past few months, a large pile of rubbish including small free stumps has accumulated at the entrance to an alley off of Northumberland Park, that provides access to 4 Bexley Road flats (212a - 218a) and is in regular use by employees of the Northumberland Heath Tesco. Easy access has become increasingly difficult, and the pile of rubbish has led to weekly waste disposal teams assuming it is the fault of residents of the flats and refusing to pick up, leading to regular missed collections of black sacks and food waste caddies kept further down the alley in neat bins. Over the weekend of Feb 21/22, more bags and even electric appliances have appeared in the pile. A large increase in vermin has been noted in the alley, as well as rubbish from the pile constantly being dragged down it and onto the pavement, likely by foxes. Bones and food scraps also appear very consistently in the entrance of the alley, though it is unclear if this is from the same pile or separate occasions of littering as it seems to occur every night. Cleanliness and accessibility are the key concerns as one of the residents of one of the alleyway’s flats uses a walking stick and can find having to traverse the refuse very difficult, especially late at night due to the lack of lighting.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8991419.0.jpeg?133f27ef&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 198-200, Northumberland Park, Northumberland Heath, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8991419&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Where cycling lane ends (southbound) and is filtered onto Royal College Street, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8991418</link>
<description>About 2 weeks ago, I have witnessed a near-miss between a cyclist and HGV lorry which was incredibly scary: the cycling path ends and cyclists need to join Royal College St and it often happens that cars simply keep going and will not slow down to allow cyclists to join safely, even when obvious. There is an inactive (I cannot even remember whether this has ever worked?) road sign, probably intended to make motorist aware, however this is turned to side and not visible. This particular HGV driver was going at high speed and did not slow down, the Uber bike cyclist was almost run over and could have gotten badly injured or killed. Please activate the illuminated road sign and make drivers aware cyclists have right of way here.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Royal College Street, Kentish Town, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8991418&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
