<title>Cancellation of Memorial Benches, 16th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8555135</link>
<description>There has been a troubling lack of care and consideration for grieving families. Lambeth accepted money we raised through GoFundMe to honour our loved one’s memory, only for a senior decision to later cancel the installation of any new benches.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This decision has caused far more distress than comfort. What was meant to bring a small sense of peace has instead reopened wounds. Emails and phone calls have gone unanswered, leaving families feeling ignored and dismissed.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We had hoped the bench would be in place for the one-year anniversary of a deeply upsetting and sudden death. Missing that moment has added to the grief rather than easing it&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8555135.0.jpeg?1489753c&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Ferndene Road, Herne Hill, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8555135&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Rubbish next to Hartley House and Jacob House, 16th December</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8555113</link>
<description>There is an ongoing problem with rubbish next to Hartley House and Jacob House on Chambers Street. It is without question the dirtiest street in the entire neighbourhood.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Last summer the council installed large street rubbish container next to our block, but this has somehow made the situation worse. People regularly leave their household rubbish in large plastic bags on the pavement beside these containers, rather than putting it inside them. Every morning the rubbish is scattered all over the street. There is a large colony of foxes living in this area, and every night they tear open the bags and spread the contents across the road and pavement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Our housekeeper is only responsible for the area within our own block, so the rubbish left along Chambers Street is not his responsibility. I do not know whether the people leaving household waste in plastic bags are residents of our block or from elsewhere. Sometimes it appears that people are simply too lazy to use the rubbish room, which already has the correct containers for different types of waste. It is also possible that residents from other blocks are leaving their rubbish here.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It seems to me that the street rubbish containers should be removed, as their presence encourages people to leave bags beside them rather than disposing of waste properly. As things stand, people will continue to dump rubbish next to the containers, and the problem will persist.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have attached a photograph taken last evening. By this morning, all of the rubbish shown had already been scattered across the street. This happens every night.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8555113.0.jpeg?d4bf4d5d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Chambers Street, Bermondsey, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8555113&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
