<title>Overcrowding at street entry, 27th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8341451</link>
<description>This street needs to have a strict enforcement of parking restrictions and the restrictions must be extended to cover the school pickup times. There is no traffic warden on this street at these times, restrictions are not at all enforced and the entry into the street gets severely impacted due to pick up cars and other people who park to use high street facilities. This is hugely detrimental for the residents who are unable to use the road between 1-5pm. Kindly extend the parking restriction hours on Deepdene Road and make sure this is properly enforced and parking tickets issued for people not following these. Kindly ensure parking wardens are doing their job here&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Deepdene Road, Welling, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8341451&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Vibrations felt near this area, 27th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8341420</link>
<description>Over the last 4/5 days or so, I have noticed there have been what felt like small vibrations from inside the house, they can also be felt on the second floor of the property. It&amp;#39;s noticeable mostly in the late evenings but sporadically during the day too.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In case this is an issue known to the Council or if is a known effect of local maintenance work etc. I thought best to report it&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Mosslea Road, Southborough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8341420&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Gully of road drain blocked, 26th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8341335</link>
<description>The road-level grille is fine, kept clear by ourselves and the monthly road sweeper, so a superficial inspection appears ok. However, the gully 4ft below is completely blocked and does not drain, so it ponds at surface level in heavy rain. The grille needs to be removed and the gully cleaned out.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 19, Goodhart Way, Park Langley, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8341335&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>The amount of leaves on our road is getting higher and higher and my garden keeps on filling in with more leaves from the road and the pavement and Bromley Council has completely neglected cleaning our road.
