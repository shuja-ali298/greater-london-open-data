<title>Side of 45 Littlemede, bushes overgrown across footway, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857435</link>
<description>I have been reporting this for about 3 years now. Concrete fence post is completely broken at the bottom and along with the rest of hedging, it’s falling across the footway. We have people with severe disabilities that use this stretch, a seriously dangerous obstacle for them especially when vehicle are parked there. This has to be dealt with immediately.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8857435.0.jpeg?eae0e46d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Littlemede, Eltham&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857435&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Extremely noisy manhole cover, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857342</link>
<description>There is a noisy manhole cover on Norman Road, directly in front of the large construction site known as Saxon Wharf. When vehicles pass over it, it produces an extremely loud, sudden noise, which is particularly disruptive at night. The sound is sharp and explosive — similar to a gunshot — and it regularly wakes residents from sleep, often causing alarm and distress. This issue has been reported to Thames Water &amp;amp; Greenwich council by residents several times but unfortunately the issue still persists. This is becoming increasingly concerning, not only because of the ongoing noise disturbance and distress, but also due to the difficulty in getting a response to what should be a relatively straightforward maintenance issue. Please could you fix it immediately? Note: this eve a person was seen on site placing wedges around the manhole which only worked, as reported by another resident before me, only.for 10.minutes. This manhole needs replacing for the residents mental wellbeing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Norman Road, Greenwich&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857342&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Hello&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Despite several reports provided by other in the neighbourhood on no lights over St Xaviour&amp;#39;s foot bridge, the Council has just not bothered to do anything.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please can the Council address this as a matter of urgency and not wait until police reports are filed when robbing takes place. The area is very dark and unsafe.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Many thanks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 26, Shad Thames, Bermondsey, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857309&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pothole missed per FixMyStreet ref: 8828586, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857162</link>
<description>Hi, can see per another resident post FixMyStreet ref: 8828586 that 5 potholes fixed but there is an equally large one further down the street here. Due to parking on both sides it is hard to avoid without almost colliding with parked cars, so needs to be filled. The road surface at the top of Highview road continues to break up several times a year during bad weather and would be more economical to resurface given the age and poor condition of this surface. Potholes that are filled typically reopen in just a few months.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8857162.0.jpeg?78213aac&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 2b, Highview Road, Albany Park, Sidcup, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857162&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Abandoned Bike 2 years +, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857094</link>
<description>This bike has been abandoned here for over 2 years. I have reported it several times. Once a council operative came and said that they &amp;quot;couldn&amp;#39;t find it&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t think it could be any clearer. It is an eyesore and takes up bike parking spaces. Remove asap&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8857094.0.jpeg?14bca4d3&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Homerton High Street, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857094&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
