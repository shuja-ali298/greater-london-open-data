<title>Large untaxed vehicled abandoned in parking area, 24th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7925209</link>
<description>There has been a large van parked at the rear of 25 Twigg Close for 2 years, it has been abandoned; it hasn`t moved during that time. It blocks the pavement to the front and rear of the parking bay. The disabled parking bay next to the van is allocated to my father in law. My mother in law uses the rear gate of their property to access their home and I am concerned about their safety. The van blocks the light to their gate and pathway. Secondary to safety/obstruction concerns, parking is difficult for neighbours and visitors, this vehicle is taking up valuable space. Please consider the powers available to you in removing this vehicle.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Twigg Close, North End, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7925209&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Lack of zig zags and large vehicles blocking traffic lights, 24th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7925199</link>
<description>Streetcare New updates on Coaches parked and blocking traffic lights Thank you for taking the time to report this to us. It is much appreciated. Our team had investigated this for you and found that this doesn&amp;#39;t fall under the responsibility of Transport for London and comes under the remit of the local authority. You may therefore wish to report this issue by using www.fixmystreet.com, or directly to the borough. Should you need anything else, please contact our customer services team on 0343 222 1234&amp;#10;&amp;#10;State changed to: not TfL’s responsibility&amp;#10;&amp;#10;TfL&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Unsubscribe from alerts about this report&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Coaches parked and blocking traffic lights I have attached a photo of the puffin crossing on the Haymarket just after St James Market. As you can see there are coached parked on both sides of the street. These coaches were completely blocking the traffic lights for the crossing. Vehicles driving down the Haymarket were not aware a crossing was there. I saw a number of cars go through the crossing on the red light narrowly avoiding pedestrians who were crossing when the green man was showing. I went and spoke to one of the drivers and he moved his coach further down the road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In such a busy area this crossing should be protected by zig zags.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The photo was taken at 1230 today the 23 July on the Haymarket at the corner of St James Market and should be visible on CCTV. I also have a short video showing vehicles going through the red lights which I can send you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7925199.0.jpeg?5e604fb1&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 3, Norris Street, Bloomsbury, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7925199&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Request for Alleyway Cleaning and Weed Removal – Clock House Station to King Hall Road, 24th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7925170</link>
<description>I am writing to request urgent attention to the alleyway that runs between Clock House Station and King Hall Road. The area has not been cleaned or maintained for over two months, and it is now heavily littered and overgrown with weeds.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This has created an unsightly and potentially unsafe environment for pedestrians. I kindly ask that your team:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sweep and remove all litter and debris from the alleyway. Cut back and clear all overgrown weeds and vegetation. Your assistance in restoring this public space to a clean and safe condition would be greatly appreciated by all who use it.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Avington Grove, Penge, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7925170&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Twigs and leaf debris in road after at least 6 drive byes., 24th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7925120</link>
<description>The road sweeper truck has gone along our road at least six times today trying to clear the debris. He has successfully cleared the gutter, but has left a trail in the road. The truck fails to suck up the debris. It would seem either his truck is full or it is defective. This has happened on numerous previous occasions, but the amount of debris is building up and will cause drain blockage. I have a series of photos after the drive byes if that would help to show the problem.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Palmar Crescent, Barnehurst, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7925120&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
