<title>Drop-down bollard not being used, 16th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8301529</link>
<description>The drop-down bollard at the pedestrian entrance to Jubilee Country Park (beside number 357) has been in the down position for weeks. When not being accessed by park staff this is supposed to be in the up position and locked. Any person in a vehicle who did not have permission could gain access to the park whilst the drop-down bollard is not in use.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Southborough Lane, Southborough, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8301529&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Urine, spit and other to entrance, basement of bew court, 16th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8301494</link>
<description>Someone has been spiting over the landing and or say on the stairs spiting. This is on the way in and inside entrance to bew court (middle block) we have a good idea who is doing this. Continuously spitting as they walk in , go up and spit over/down. Although the person should be made to clean this up, neither have the cleaners and the inside to this block has not been kept or sanitised for a long time now. Same with the basement both NEED a good scrubbing!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8301494.0.jpeg?431a075f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Overhill Road, East Dulwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8301494&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Dried urine, 16th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8301492</link>
<description>Absolutely disgusting. This area has not been cleaned for months. Bew Court Entrance to basement/bin &amp;amp; cleaners staff room area. Cleaners can clearly see this EVERYDAY! They have no intentions of cleaning it on thier own accord. It looks like someone has urinated behind the bin door and on top of dried urine that was never cleaned before that. Also a mix of sticky/spelt liquid from rubbish etc. We will not walk over it to take our rubbish down and therefore use the next block up which is also just as bad. What has happened to the lordship land estate. Itâ€™s a mess, yet we have more cleaners than we ever did before !!&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8301492.0.jpeg?431a075f&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Overhill Road, East Dulwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8301492&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>I am unable to lock my bike, 15th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8301434</link>
<description>I am unable to lock my bike outside Marks &amp;amp; Spencerâ€˜s because the line bikes have taken all of the bike stands. The team inside Marks &amp;amp; Spencerâ€˜s say that they have contacted the council multiple times about this because their customers canâ€™t lock their bikes itâ€™s so frustrating this is like the fifth time. Why are Lime allowed to use all of the bike stands when their bikes donâ€™t even need locks.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8301434.0.jpeg?e7423ec9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 446-450, Brixton Road, Brixton, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8301434&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
