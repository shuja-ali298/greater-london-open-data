<title>Chesterfield Grove (opposite the car wash)-Flytipping- 3rd Complaint, 7th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857858</link>
<description>3rd complaint: There are 2 pellats that could fall on pedestrians. 2 chairs dumped (7th complaint) where furniture should be appropriately disposed of. It is completely unacceptable that this is a site for dumping of rubbish and nothing is being done about the removal of them, which will encourage more flytipping.The Duty of Care is not being demonstrated of not abiding by the law in regards to the responsible manner of rubbish disposal/removal. Health and safety of the residents and wider community should be paramount.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8857858.0.jpeg?6d9ab371&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 25, Chesterfield Grove, East Dulwich, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857858&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pothole around 40cm wide and 10cm deep, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857634</link>
<description>I am writing to report a pothole on Kingsland Road, London, specifically outside the properties numbered 321-325 Kingsland Road, postcode E8 4DL.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The pothole appears quite deep and deteriorating. It poses a significant hazard to vehicles (risk of tyre damage, loss of control, especially for cyclists and motorbikes) and could cause accidents if not addressed promptly, particularly during wet weather or at night.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;It causes severe dirt and splashes of gravel on to our window, doors and shutters and leaving the entrance to our business ruined. We are losing customers on a daily basis and have to pay a cleaning firm to come and clean all the time.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I believe this requires urgent attention as it is worsening and could lead to injury and further damage. If possible, please prioritise an inspection and repair.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;For reference:&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Location: Kingsland Road, outside 321-325&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Approximate size/depth: around 40cm wide and 10cm deep.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Date observed: 31th of January 2026&amp;#10;&amp;#10;• Additional notes: please see attached images and videos&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please confirm receipt of this report and provide a reference number if you have a tracking system. I would appreciate any update on when an inspection or repair might take place.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your prompt attention to this safety issue.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8857634.0.jpeg?9f6a21be&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 321, Kingsland Road, Haggerston, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8857634&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
