<title>Croft way residents unable to get to there houses due to no yellow lines, 30th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7953241</link>
<description>I am writing to express ongoing concerns regarding the parking situation on the narrow road leading to Baxley.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Residents have been experiencing severe difficulties for over a year due to vehicles being parked along this narrow stretch. As shown in the attached image, parked cars restrict access to the point where the road becomes virtually impassable for larger vehicles or when two cars meet.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Despite repeated complaints and assurances that a meeting would be held to address the matter, no action has been taken. In the meantime, local residents continue to suffer on a weekly basis.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We are once again requesting that yellow lines be painted along the road to prevent parking where the width is insufficient. The current situation poses a risk not only to traffic flow but also to emergency access and general safety.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;We would appreciate an urgent update on when action will finally be taken.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 1, Croft Way, Longlands, Sidcup, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7953241&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>This car was brought up to our car park by tow truck, two weeks ago. Air bags have been activated, so must of been in crash of some sort.

<title>Pole outside my house, 30th July</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7953204</link>
<description>This pole was put in last week without any consideration to ask us as the home owner if this would be ok. I understand there is for the permits but this causes an obstruction outside my house and also an eyesore. We are looking into getting a drive put in which now causes complications due to the nature of where the pole has been placed. Also the cement on the pathway is not secure and the pole is wobbly. I have two children under 5 and if this was to fall on them! I would like the pole removed and placed elsewhere. We already have a lamp post which the permit sign could be added on to instead.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7953204.0.jpeg?1362be32&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Elstree Gardens, Lessness Heath, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7953204&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Flytipping, 30th July</title>

<description>All this junk used to be in the alleyway between 31 and 32 mottingham road that circles round the back of 32 onwards. Someones now moved it from the alleyway onto 31 mottingham road. This is flytipping and is completely unacceptable. I expect its the same person who&amp;#39;s left the bag of other junk by the bin as well. Please remove this and investigate who&amp;#39;s been flytipping as its clearly a recurring issue now.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7953013.0.jpeg?3e41ee95&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 31, Mottingham Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7953013&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
