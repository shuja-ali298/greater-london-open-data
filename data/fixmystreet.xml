<title>Dog poo on pavement - 4th time raising this, 4th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8838496</link>
<description>Once again there is an owner letting their dog poo on the pavement and not picking it up. It is always on the left side pavement of Westbury Road.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have put up 2 previous posts about this and nothing has been done so as you can imagine they continue to do it. It is dark in the morning when people are leaving for work so there’s a high likelihood someone will step in this. Please address this it’s been going on for a long time. Put up cameras and give them a fine or something instead of just marking this as fixed when you have done nothing&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8838496.0.jpeg?519ebc1b&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Westbury Road, Penge, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8838496&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Large items of dumped furniture and panels have been left next to the building’s entrance door.

<title>Loose manhole cover in road causing noise nuisance, 4th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8838349</link>
<description>This manhole cover is loose, and every time a car goes over it, it makes a lot of noise. This is often, and all day and night, as it is a very busy road. It is disturbing the peace of myself and neighbours and causing a noise nuisance, especially at night. It has been like this for several months now.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8838349.0.jpeg?207588f9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bromley Road, Shortlands, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8838349&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Nuisance bins, 4th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8838277</link>
<description>No 82 St Margaret&amp;#39;s Terrace was illegally sub-divided into 7 flats some time ago. The residents have constantly misused their blue and green bins which now appear to have been confiscated, so there are only 4 black top bins between 7 flats. This picture doesn&amp;#39;t show the worst of it but they are constantly overflowing, blocking the pavement and attract fly tipping. What is most annoying is they have a bin store which could hold these bins but it is unused and also full of rubbish. I have complained to the letting agent (The Property Experts) multiple times but they don&amp;#39;t care and have hung up the phone on me and ignored emails! This problem has been going on for years and needs to be resolved.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8838277.0.jpeg?0d1a15c5&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): St Margarets Terrace, Plumstead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8838277&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
