<description>This small park services the bulk of the community between Rochester Way and Westbourne Avenue the park is in dire need of equipment and update to the facilities. It is an absolute neglect at the moment. The only park that is being looked after and in a good condition is all the way up on Rochester way towards thomas tallis school Which is quite a distance away. It’s as the park has just gone completely to the dogs.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Briset Road, Well Hall, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751660&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Graffiti - Alice Street., 23rd June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751595</link>
<description>Vandalism in the form of graffiti. It’s an eyesore (which is facing a road) detrimental to the neighbourhood and of course criminal damage to private property contrary to the Criminal Damage Act 1971. As well as being cleaned up by the perpetrators need to be caught and prosecuted.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7751595.0.jpeg?66d7ddaa&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 27, Alice Street, Walworth, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751595&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fly tipping on green, 23rd June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751575</link>
<description>There is a ton of rubbish that has been dumped on the green that is belonging to all of the people. This has to be becoming cleaned up every time I walk out my house. I look at it. I expect somebody to come and clean this up all the people to be told to clean this up. Quite happy for it to be deemed private property and for us to be allowed to put up our own private hedges so that we don’t have to look at that but it is absolutely an eye sore.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7751575.0.jpeg?0af055fc&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Westhorne Avenue, Well Hall, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751575&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Ladies and disabled toilets dirty, blocked etc, 23rd June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751557</link>
<description>The ladies and disabled toilets are disgusting, they have NOT been cleaned properly since they were re-opened in Jan/Feb. Toilets are not cleaned, no sign of bleach or toilet cleaner, floor is not mopped. It is occasionally swept. No toilet paper. If I see the man who unlocks the toilets in morning I have to beg him to replenish the paper, &amp;#39;its not his job to clean&amp;#39; apparently. This is a public Health &amp;amp; Safety issue, that needs addressing. the toilets need to be cleaned regularly. Especially after the park has had an event on like this weekend.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Danson Park, Welling, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751557&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Danger to pedestrians, 23rd June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751490</link>
<description>For over the past year extensive building works have been taking place at the south end of Berkeley Square, resulting in the removal of the pavement along one side of Fitzmaurice Place, W1J5JD. A zebra crossing gave access to that pavement at the Berkeley Square entrance to Fitzmaurice Place. Anyone now wanting to cross from Fitzmaurice Place into Lansdowne Row faces danger because there is no zebra crossing, no traffic lights or anything else to regulate the flow of heavy traffic. The problem is even more acute evenings/weekends because parked cars block from view the oncoming traffic through Fitzmaurice Place. An even more dangerous situation is evidenced by the 3 attached photos taken last Thursday evening 19 June around 21.00 h when a delivery container blocked virtually the entire entrance into Lansdowne Row. Those pedestrians who managed to cross from Fitzmaurice Place had to squeeze into the miniscule opening behind the, or go directly beneath the raised, container. Lastly, yesterday afternoon Sunday 22 June, I came upon a very elderly pedestrian of compromised mobility and using a walking stick who was trying to negotiate this crossing (from Fitzmaurice Place into Lansdowne Row). He had been waiting for a long time and was unable to cross because of oncoming traffic. I waited for a brief lull in traffic and ensured the traffic was halted until we both safely got to the other side.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is clearly a dangerous situation that has been allowed to continue for too long. Please let me know how you plan to remedy this dangerous situation.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7751490.0.jpeg?9c8761f3&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Dorchester Ride, Belgravia, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7751490&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
