<title>Majore pothole on road in front of Heal&#39;s, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856929</link>
<description>There is a deep pothole at Tottenham Court Road, near Goodge Street station (in fron of the Heal&amp;#39;s shop). It could be very hazardous for cyclists or motor/scooter drivers, who risk serious injury if they ride over it. The depth and low visibility of the pothole increases the danger, especially under busy traffic conditions or poor lighting. Urgent action is required&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8856929.0.jpeg?1e8fc165&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 199, Tottenham Court Road, Fitzrovia, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856929&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Spray paint parking sign, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856821</link>
<description>Someone has spray painted a lot of the permit only parking signs in this area, this report relates to the one outside 45 langton road. I think the council should coordinate with the police about this issue which is happening a lot locally.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8856821.0.jpeg?14e129e0&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 41, Langton Road, Loughborough Junction, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856821&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Several streetlights are out between Champion Hill Estate and Sainsbury&amp;#39;s including the one above the concrete steps, making them very dangerous. The Dog Kennel Hill Open Space also feels very unsafe in total darkness. These have been reported multiple times.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Estate Road, East Dulwich, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856793&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Too many potholes on very steep vehicle busy hill, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856784</link>
<description>The potholes have worsened and new ones appeared and continue to appear weekly due to a very large increase in works traffic with a new development at the top of the hill. Ironically a works vehicle HGV stopped to see if I was alright after the pothole launched me off of my bike onto the pavement.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;In addition Thames Water have had 3 different cases close the road to rip it up and made the road unsafe with insufficient repairs after their work.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The hill is too steep for even advanced cyclists to also dodge too many potholes whilst riding into the line of 2-way traffic on a road that is too busy to be safe with the potholes.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I have had accidents on this road in the past but I am forced to take this to reporting this now because I can physically no longer cycle down this hill with the potholes obscuring the path and forcing unsafe manoeuvres into the oncoming traffic with parked cars often either side further narrowing the road. I am having to climb off my bicycle and wheel it down Lewisham Hill. My body is still bruised and I don&amp;#39;t wish this on anybody coming down the hill.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Sometimes I have cycled down the hill at night after work and despite having very bright bicycle lights it is very scary and dangerous jamming on the breaks causing a hazard for vehicles behind, creating a traffic jam on the hill whilst dodging very large and numerous potholes with reduced visibility whilst the cars tried to overtake and being obstructed by oncoming vehicles causing further danger.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The risk of danger is very high. The hazard is almost unavoidable and this road is so dangerous that in my 10 years of cycling in London&amp;#39;s North, North East, East, South, and South East areas I have never experienced any road this dangerous or has caused so much fear with cycling.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please make this road safe and accessible to avoid anyone having a serious accident or death.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8856784.0.jpeg?f5b6e6df&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 55,57, Lewisham Hill, Deptford, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856784&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>In front of the Guitar Guitar shop, towards Signmakers Yard, 6th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856626</link>
<description>A manhole is sunken and rocking. Every time a car passes from Delancey St. they pass over that manhole due to road works narrowing the carriage on the other side of the street, and the manhole makes a very loud clanging sound every time a tyre passes over it. It&amp;#39;s very disturbing to me and other residents with windows facing Delancey Street (despite the double-glazing) and presumably to residents of other nearby buildings as well and guests of the hotel on the corner. It&amp;#39;s been going on for a few days now (at least 3 days).&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 9A, Delancey Street, Chalk Farm, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8856626&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
