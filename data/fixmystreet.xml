<title>Damage to both sides of the road, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668879</link>
<description>The last couple of weeks have been very unkind to this section of road - multiple holese opening up on both sides of the road. This is just one example.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8668879.0.jpeg?dbf19c87&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 17, Fleet Street, City of London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668879&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Constant rubbish dumped, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668833</link>
<description>Local businesses and domestic homes use this corner to dump rubbish. There is a daily morning council collection from here presumably for the business refuse, but foxes usually open the bags at night and then the collection vehicle only take bags and leave any debris that has come out of the rubbish bags. This corner is constantly littered with rubbish.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8668833.0.jpeg?115b8f08&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lamb Walk, The Borough, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668833&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>From 1 year ago we have those scooters in our staircase entrance. One of them contains batteries which is extremely dangerous to our building. Recently someone left also a foldable bike. The access is very narrow right now and not safe.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8668787.0.jpeg?3b2935a9&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Carter Street, Walworth, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668787&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Large, long potholes and gaps between carriage surface joins, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668762</link>
<description>Where two (parallel) lanes of road surface have been paid, large gaps are present. Considering this is a 40mph road, and a roundabout, it is very dangerous for motorcycles and car drivers alike. There are several of these long, deep gaps between the lanes on this part of the roundabout (exit of Eastern Way and Carlyle Road). Another, smaller pothole (https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8620245) was fixed within weeks of it appearing.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Byron Close, Thamesmead&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668762&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Mot Expired, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668728</link>
<description>&amp;quot;We would like to report a vehicle that appears to have been abandoned in our local car park. The car’s MOT expired over a year and eight months ago, and it has remained stationary in the same spot for some time, taking up valuable space that could be used by other drivers. Could someone please arrange for an assessment of the vehicle and, if appropriate, arrange for its removal in line with relevant procedures? We would be grateful for your support in resolving this matter.&amp;quot;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8668728.0.jpeg?3d358fbf&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Sarre Road, Poverest, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668728&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Car Taking Space, 11th January</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668708</link>
<description>&amp;quot;I wanted to bring to your attention a vehicle that has been parked in the car park for several months now – from what I can tell, it has remained in the same spot without being moved or used for at least three months. While I understand that car parks are intended for legitimate use by those who need them, this particular car is taking up a valuable parking space that could otherwise be used by residents, visitors, or people accessing local facilities. It appears to be unoccupied for extended periods, with no visible signs of recent use such as clean windshields, fresh tire marks, or updated parking permits. Given the limited number of spaces available in this area, the presence of this stationary vehicle is becoming increasingly inconvenient for others who rely on the car park on a regular basis. Would it be possible to arrange for it to be assessed and, if appropriate, removed in accordance with local regulations or car park management policies? I would be grateful for your assistance in addressing this matter.&amp;quot;&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8668708.0.jpeg?70e1a581&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Sarre Road, Poverest, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8668708&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
