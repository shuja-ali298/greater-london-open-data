<title>Strong winds breaking dead and living branches off tree, 13th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286700</link>
<description>Have seen trees being pruned around the borough but have never seen any attention given to the very mature oak trees at the bottom of Mead Way. When there are strong winds there are always dead branches broken off and landing on grass and pavement and during storm Amy it was living branches. Concerned about adults and children getting hit by these branches as they fall. Particularly concerned about the oaks on the even side.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8286700.0.jpeg?12df5d8d&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 4, Mead Way, Hayes, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286700&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Weekends are the worst over 28 line bikes dumped all over the place even leaning on residents, visitors vehicles causing damaged to their cars because bikes of being left in dangerous, inconsiderate way. What is the mayor of Hackney doing about this nuisance and anti-social behavior with these line bikes everywhere. I live in the area and I have motability issues, disabled and often have to try move lime bikes off my car or out the way. Lime bikes laying in public roads causing a hazard to other road users., 12th October</title>

<description>Antisocial behaviour line bikes. Why is the mayor and authority not addressing these issues is it because mayor and authority are getting a big chunk of money from the investment company line bike and leasing bays two company.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8286691.0.jpeg?b21a5830&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Semley Gate, Hackney, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286691&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>Enormous flytip. Fridge, cabinets, clothes, DIY waste and general rubbish. Pavement completely obstructed. Reported multiple times over the last week by myself and others. All equally appalled that Brent Council have not cleared this sooner, which has encouraged further dumping at this side.

<title>Unconfined active construction site with open trenches and construction materials scattered., 12th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286666</link>
<description>The whole length of Beak St was not properly fenced, protected or signed. Pedestrians clambering over open trenches. Construction materials scattered. Accident waiting to happen. Called the Compass Infrastructure emergency phone and got the auto operator with options. Pressed 5 to report an emergency. Engaged. All afternoon. Tried all the other options. All continuously engaged. Given the proximity to one of the UK&amp;#39;s premium tourist assets it was a disgraceful display of poor construction and a health and safety hazard. I am in construction and I have never seen such a bad live site in the UK. UKPN and Compass need to be called out about this urgently.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8286666.0.jpeg?05c7d7de&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 35, Beak Street, City of Westminster&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286666&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Continuous Parking Issue!, 12th October</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286656</link>
<description>There is a continuous and problematic parking issue on Bourneside Gardens and a safety concern on Primrose Close. There are not enough parking spaces for residents on Bourneside Gardens. Residents and visitors are struggling to park, and vehicles are now parking on grass verges and tight spaces between houses, especially at turning points. This blocks access for others trying to enter or leave their homes and prevents people from turning around. A large silver van is parked long-term and rarely moves. Another work van belonging to a resident at 10 Bourneside Gardens (We believe the tenant is subletting) is parked daily and purposely takes up two spaces adding to the issue. These vehicles are taking up much-needed space. Parking permits were previously considered but shelved – I strongly request that permits are reconsidered to prioritise residents.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On Primrose Close, there is a white Ford Transit Van (Reg: RO65 CDZ) that has been parked for around six months. A man is living in it. The van has no MOT or tax and he is using gas canisters inside, creating a serious safety risk. It is also impacting the appearance of the area. Please investigate and take appropriate action on both matters. Thank you.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/8286656.0.jpeg?074c7425&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Bourneside Gardens, Southend, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8286656&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
