<title>Dog fouling on Anerley Road, 24th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758765</link>
<description>I have increasingly noticed dog muck on Anerley Road for the last couple of weeks. I have had to clean dog dirt after opening my gate and stepping into it, and I have repeatedly had to dodge dog dirt on my way on this road. I&amp;#39;ve lived here for 7 years - I appreciate there is going to be dog dirt from time to time, but I would say this is getting increasingly worse.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Anerley Road, Anerley, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758765&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Churchill Gardens Dry Pond, 24th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758746</link>
<description>I am writing to express concern that the pond has been allowed to dry out completely. While I understand that recent weather has been unusually hot and dry, it is disappointing that no preventative action appears to have been taken.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The Council should explore practical solutions, such as requesting support from the London Fire Brigade to replenish the water levels. The absence of local ducks and geese underscores the environmental impact of this neglect.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;I urge Bromley Council to take immediate steps to preserve our local green spaces and protect the natural wildlife that depends on them.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Tetty Way, Plaistow, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758746&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Enfield council nd police not addressing dangerous driving, 24th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758742</link>
<description>Enfield council turned all roads to LTNs then put cycle lanes on green lanes. Consequently the council have increased traffic and traffic speed on hoppers road a thousand fold. Our lives are blighted with speeding of 40 plus mph on a residential road, despite an entirely unmonitored 20 mph. . It is strange which roads have become LTNs. But why are reg council and police ignoring traffic volume and traffic speed on hoppers road.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Hoppers Road, Palmers Green, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758742&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>There is becoming a big issue of criminal activity and antisocial behavior on the Trowbridge estate. if someone from the local council could answer these questions and address these issues raised. why is it the local Olympic village silk mill Square and meadow square have had an update of CCTV surveillance cameras connected in partnership with the metropolitan police and Hackney Council while they leave the old Trowbridge estate without any CCTV making it a free-for-all for criminal behavior and displacing the anti-social behavior what took place where the CCTV has been installed but now has been moved to other parts of the estate as a dumping ground. Maybe this is due to Hackney Council not having enough money or just making other residence on the other side of Trowbridge estate suffer in squalo and slums. The metropolitan police commissioner sir Mark Rowley only can afford to stick one camera on the old Trowbridge estate Merriam Ave but metropolitan and Hackney Council stick loads in the Olympic village no common sense displacing antisocial behavior. Hackney Council has taken over the planning authority for the Olympic village in Hackney Wick, including Silk Mill Square, from the London Legacy Development Corporation (LLDC). This transfer began on September 1, 2024, with Hackney Council taking responsibility for decisions on new planning applications. From December 1, 2024, the council will also manage local planning policies and determine planning gain levies. As of December 1, 2024, the planning powers will be transferred from LLDC to Hackney Council, including determining local planning policies and levies on new developments., 24th June</title>

<title>Prime estate agents advertising sign on the pavement, 24th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758727</link>
<description>This is a conservation area, but the estate agent Prime Collection has a sign obstructing the pavement outside 18a Hanson St. This is a fairly new sign. The attached photo was taken at 2114hrs, so to aggravate the situation the illegal sign will probably be left there overnight to the detriment of the disabled, the partially sighted and wheelchair users. The rubbish is also a problem, but the sign is more important.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7758727.0.jpeg?0f4cc5a8&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 17, Hanson Street, Fitzrovia, Camden Town, City of Westminster&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758727&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Pavement around tree pits risen and serious trip hazard, 24th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758721</link>
<description>On Lynton Road, especially from the Red sweet shop up to the junction where City of London School is, there are several trees where the pavement has risen, causing serious trip hazards. There is also not enough room between the trees and the gates for wheelchairs and buggy’s to get past, forcing people to walk in the dangerous road with their buggies. I have reported this several times over the last 2 years but nothing has been done and the situation has just got worse so this is the final straw before I make a formal complaint to the head of the council. I live on Bermondsey Street and I walk through to Southwark Park Road every morning along the same route and I have done for over 2 years and I think the streets have just got worse. I actually find myself wondering if the streets of Bermondsey are ever inspected for faults as there seem to be a lot of them. I don’t know what the process is but it’s clearly not working.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Lynton Road, Old Kent Road, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7758721&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
