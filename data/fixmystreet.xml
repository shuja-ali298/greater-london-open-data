<title>20 Ospringe road communal garden/public pathway, 24th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8991903</link>
<description>A tree located in our communal garden that appears to be causing structural damage to our concrete boundary wall, which borders the public pathway.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The tree’s roots seem to be affecting the stability of the wall, and it is also heavily covered in ivy that has taken over much of the tree. We are concerned that this may pose a safety hazard, particularly if the wall were to collapse onto the public footpath.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Given the potential risk to both our property and public safety, we would like to request permission to have the tree removed or for the council to remove the tree.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 23, Ospringe Road, Tufnell Park, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8991903&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
