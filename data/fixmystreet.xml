<title>Dog Fouling - on the pavement on the entire street, 19th February</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8954164</link>
<description>I am writing to report an ongoing issue with dog fouling on the public pavement outside my property on Hervey Road, Blackheath, SE3.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The fouling is often left directly outside my gate and along the full stretch of pavement in front of my home. As I have children, this raises hygiene concerns and makes it unpleasant when entering and leaving the property.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;On several occasions, I have cleaned the area myself in order to ensure it is safe, especially as The Pointers School children regularly walk down this street to access their playing field.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;However, as this appears to be a recurring issue, I would be grateful if the matter could be looked into and if any appropriate measures, such as patrols or signage, could be considered.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Please could you confirm receipt of this email and provide a reference number for the report? I would also appreciate an indication of the next steps or expected timeframe for review.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;Thank you for your assistance.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest address to the pin placed on the map (from OS Places API): Hervey Road, Kidbrooke&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8954164&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>This whole patch of road has been defective for over 2 years - Yet have done nothing but keep it getting worse and is now utterly shameful&amp;#10;&amp;#10;The whole patch is at an unacceptably level and it&amp;#39;s horrible to drive on, it&amp;#39;s causing damage to cars, the suspension and tyres.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;There are cars and bicycles going into the opposite lane to drive better. Why are you letting things get this bad?&amp;#10;&amp;#10;You need to resurface the road and sort it out immediately.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;This is a serious safety issue for both cars and cyclists.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): Prince Albert Road, Chalk Farm, Greater London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/8954028&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<description>I think this has already been reported (FixMyStreet ref: 8844446) but it seems your contractors ran out of tarmac or something. It&amp;#39;s been HALF filled but it&amp;#39;s still a major crater there, exactly where cycles need to go over which is a major hazard to us. Please fix properly.
