<title>Please could put up some more signs on Fernhead Road opposite St Luke&#39;s Church of England primary school encouraging dog owners to clean up after their dogs., 10th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691339</link>
<description>Please could you put up some signs opposite St Luke&amp;#39;s Church of England primary school encouraging dog owners to clean up after their dogs. There needs to be some signs on both sides of Fernhead Road. Because this is becoming a problem again. Some of the signs that have been put up have been taken down, or moved to the level of the pavement by irresponsible dog owners who have taken offence. Fernhead Road is particularly bad with dog fouling especially towards the middle end of Fernhead Road and towards the Harrow Road end. More signs need to be put up. In a bid to clean up Fernhead Road. Thank you in anticipation.&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 95, Fernhead Road, Kensal Town, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691339&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Bin blocking pavement, 10th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691024</link>
<description>This large bin outside the nursery has been blocking half the pavement for many months, making it narrow and unsafe. Especially dangerous as it&amp;#39;s by a nursery so many small children will be walking there. It&amp;#39;s nerve-racking to walk by here with a buggy or with small children as it&amp;#39;s near a very busy road. It&amp;#39;s also always open/overflowing and attracting squirrels.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7691024.0.jpeg?1e7c2d54&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): East Dulwich Road, East Dulwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691024&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>

<title>Fly tipping and contaminated recycling bins, 10th June</title>
<link>https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691020</link>
<description>Fly tipping of furniture and other waste has recommenced outside 2a Combedale Road. This has been an issue for 2-3 weeks.&amp;#10;&amp;#10;As in late, 2023 when fly tipping was also an issue, contaminated recycling bins are also no longer being collected which encourages other to fly tip. These bins need to be removed to stop this issue and reduce the risk of vermin problems.&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://www.fixmystreet.com/photo/7691020.0.jpeg?eb9e50e2&quot;&gt;&#10;&lt;br&gt;Nearest road to the pin placed on the map (automatically generated by OpenStreetMap): 104, Woolwich Road, East Greenwich, London&#10;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&#39;https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7691020&#39;&gt;Report on FixMyStreet&lt;/a&gt;</description>
